 The President has invoked the Alien Enemies Act (AEA), Rev. Stat. §4067, 50 U. S. C. §21, to remove Venezuelan nationals who are members of Tren de Aragua (TdA), a designated foreign terrorist organization. See Presidential Proclamation No. 10903, 90 Fed. Reg. 13033 (2025). Applicants are two detainees identified as members of TdA and a putative class of similarly situated detainees in the Northern District of Texas. All of the alleged TdA members in the putative class are currently being held in U. S. detention facilities. In the application before the Court, the detainees seek injunctive relief against summary removal under the AEA.
I
 On April 17, 2025, the District Court denied the detainees’ motion for a temporary restraining order (TRO) against summary removal under the AEA. No. 25−cv−59, ECF Doc. 27. The detainees allege that, hours later, putative class members were served notices of AEA removal and told that they would be removed “tonight or tomorrow.” ECF Doc. 30, p. 1. On April 18 at 12:34 a.m. central time, the detainees moved for an emergency TRO. See ibid. At 12:48 p.m., the detainees moved for a ruling on that motion or a status conference by 1:30 p.m. ECF Doc. 34. At 3:02 p.m., they appealed “the constructive denia[l]” of the emergency TRO  to the Fifth Circuit. ECF Doc. 36, p. 1. The detainees also applied to this Court for a temporary injunction.
 We understood the Government to assert the right to remove the detainees as soon as midnight central time on April 19. The Government addressed the detainees’ allegations on April 18 only at an evening hearing before the District Court for the District of Columbia, where the detainees had separately sought relief. The Government guaranteed that no putative class members would be removed that day. Tr. of Proceedings in J. G. G. v. Trump, No. 25−cv−766, ECF Doc. 93, p. 9. But it further represented that, in its view, removal of putative class members as soon as the next day “would be consistent with” its due process obligations, and it “reserve[d] the right” to take such action. Id., at 26; see id., at 16 (explanation by the court that “tomorrow . . . starts at 12:01 a.m.”). Evidence now in the record (although not all before us on April 18) suggests that the Government had in fact taken steps on the afternoon of April 18 toward removing detainees under the AEA—including transporting them from their detention facility to an airport and later returning them to the facility. See Supp. App. to Reply 1a−5a. Had the detainees been removed from the United States to the custody of a foreign sovereign on April 19, the Government may have argued, as it has previously argued, that no U. S. court had jurisdiction to order relief. See Application To Vacate Injunction in Noem v. Abrego Garcia, No. 24A949 (Apr. 7, 2025), pp. 11−20.
 At 12:52 a.m. eastern time (11:52 p.m. central time), we ordered the Government—in light of all these circumstances—“not to remove any member of the putative class of detainees” in order to preserve our jurisdiction to consider the application. 604 U. S. ___ (2025). We invited the Government to respond to that application after the Fifth Circuit ruled. The Fifth Circuit dismissed the detainees’ appeal for lack of jurisdiction and denied their motion for injunction pending appeal as premature, on the ground that  the detainees “gave the [district] court only 42 minutes to act.” No. 25−10534, ECF Doc. 14, p. 2. We now construe the application as a petition for writ of certiorari from the decision of the Fifth Circuit. See Reply 15. We grant the petition as well as the application for injunction pending further proceedings, vacate the judgment of the Fifth Circuit, and remand for further proceedings.
II
 The Fifth Circuit erred in dismissing the detainees’ appeal for lack of jurisdiction. Appellate courts have jurisdiction to review interlocutory orders that have “the practical effect of refusing an injunction.” Carson v. American Brands, Inc., 450 U. S. 79, 84 (1981). A district court’s inaction in the face of extreme urgency and a high risk of “serious, perhaps irreparable,” consequences may have the effect of refusing an injunction. 16 C. Wright, A. Miller, & E. Cooper, Federal Practice and Procedure §3924.1, pp. 174, 180−181 (3d ed. 2012) (quoting Baltimore Contractors, Inc. v. Bodinger, 348 U. S. 176, 181 (1955)). Here the District Court’s inaction—not for 42 minutes but for 14 hours and 28 minutes—had the practical effect of refusing an injunction to detainees facing an imminent threat of severe, irreparable harm. Accordingly, we vacate the judgment of the Court of Appeals.
 “[T]he Fifth Amendment entitles aliens to due process of law in the context of removal proceedings.” Trump v. J. G. G., 604 U. S. ___, ___ (2025) (per curiam) (slip op., at 3) (internal quotation marks omitted). “Procedural due process rules are meant to protect” against “the mistaken or unjustified deprivation of life, liberty, or property.” Carey v. Piphus, 435 U. S. 247, 259 (1978). We have long held that “no person shall be” removed from the United States “without opportunity, at some time, to be heard.” The Japanese Immigrant Case, 189 U. S. 86, 101 (1903). Due process requires notice that is “reasonably calculated, under all the  circumstances, to apprise interested parties” and that “afford[s] a reasonable time . . . to make [an] appearance.” Mullane v. Central Hanover Bank & Trust Co., 339 U. S. 306, 314 (1950). Accordingly, in J. G. G., this Court explained—with all nine Justices agreeing—that “AEA detainees must receive notice . . . that they are subject to removal under the Act . . . within a reasonable time and in such a manner as will allow them to actually seek habeas relief ” before removal. 604 U. S., at ____ (slip op., at 3). In order to “actually seek habeas relief,” a detainee must have sufficient time and information to reasonably be able to contact counsel, file a petition, and pursue appropriate relief.
 The Government does not contest before this Court the applicants’ description of the notice afforded to AEA detainees in the Northern District of Texas, nor the assertion that the Government was poised to carry out removals imminently. The Government has represented elsewhere that it is unable to provide for the return of an individual deported in error to a prison in El Salvador, see Abrego Garcia v. Noem, No. 25−cv−951 (D Md.), ECF Docs. 74, 77, where it is alleged that detainees face indefinite detention, see Application for Injunction 11. The detainees’ interests at stake are accordingly particularly weighty. Under these circumstances, notice roughly 24 hours before removal, devoid of information about how to exercise due process rights to contest that removal, surely does not pass muster. But it is not optimal for this Court, far removed from the circumstances on the ground, to determine in the first instance the precise process necessary to satisfy the Constitution in this case. We remand the case to the Fifth Circuit for that purpose.
 To be clear, we decide today only that the detainees are entitled to more notice than was given on April 18, and we grant temporary injunctive relief to preserve our jurisdiction while the question of what notice is due is adjudicated. See post, at 13 (ALITO, J., dissenting). We did not on April  19—and do not now—address the underlying merits of the parties’ claims regarding the legality of removals under the AEA. We recognize the significance of the Government’s national security interests as well as the necessity that such interests be pursued in a manner consistent with the Constitution. In light of the foregoing, lower courts should address AEA cases expeditiously.
III
 The dissent disputes both the Court’s jurisdiction and the availability of classwide relief. We do not find its reasoning persuasive.
 First, we reject the dissent’s characterization of the events that transpired on April 18, which lead it to question our jurisdiction. District courts should approach requests for preliminary relief with care and consideration, see post, at 3−4 (ALITO, J., dissenting), but exigent circumstances may impose practical constraints. Preliminary relief is “customarily granted on the basis of procedures that are less formal and evidence that is less complete than in a trial on the merits.” Lackey v. Stinnie, 604 U. S. ___, ___ (2025) (slip op., at 6) (quoting University of Tex. v. Camenisch, 451 U. S. 390, 395 (1981)). The purpose of such relief is “merely to preserve the relative positions of the parties” pending further proceedings. Lackey, 604 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 6) (quoting Camenisch, 451 U. S., at 395).
 In this case, the record before the District Court, although limited, indicated that removals of putative class members were likely imminent. Contra, post, at 4−6 (ALITO, J., dissenting). The detainees attached four declarations to their emergency motion for a TRO. In one, for example, an attorney relayed a detainee’s report that immigration officers “had informed them that they will be deported either today or tomorrow.” ECF Doc. 30−1. In a second, a nonprofit director described conversations with  family members of detainees and linked to a video of detainees holding notices of removal as evidence that detainees “were being removed.” ECF Doc. 30−2.
 Importantly, the relevant question for purposes of our jurisdiction is whether, at the time this Court was called upon to intervene, the District Court’s inaction had the effect of refusing an injunction. In their application to this Court, the detainees represented that “[m]any individuals [had] already been loaded on to buses, presumably headed to the airport.” Application for Injunction 1. Shortly thereafter, the Government represented on the record in federal court that it reserved the right to remove detainees after midnight. We had the power to issue injunctive relief to prevent irreparable harm to the applicants and to preserve our jurisdiction over the matter. 28 U. S. C. §1651(a). Now that the Fifth Circuit has ruled, our certiorari jurisdiction also supports review in the ordinary course.
 Finally, this Court may properly issue temporary injunctive relief to the putative class in order to preserve our jurisdiction pending appeal.1 Named applicants A. A. R. P. and W. M. M. assert that they are at imminent risk of being classified as alien enemies and removed from the United  States, but the record does not indicate that they have received any formal notice of removal under the AEA. See ECF Doc. 38, pp. 5−6. The named applicants, along with putative class members, are entitled to constitutionally adequate notice prior to any removal, in order to pursue appropriate relief. Although the putative class members may ultimately take different steps to protect their own interests in response to such notice, the notice to which they are entitled is the same. And because courts may issue temporary relief to a putative class, see 2 W. Rubenstein, Newberg & Rubenstein on Class Actions §4:30 (6th ed. 2022 and Supp. 2024), we need not decide whether a class should be certified as to the detainees’ due process claims in order to temporarily enjoin the Government from removing putative class members while the question of what notice is due is adjudicated.
 We recognize that the Government “has agreed to forgo removing the named petitioners pursuant to the AEA while their habeas proceedings are pending.” Opposition to Emergency Application 11. But we reject the proposition that a class-action defendant may defeat class treatment, if it is otherwise proper, by promising as a matter of grace to treat named plaintiffs differently. Cf. FBI v. Fikre, 601 U. S. 234, 241 (2024) (explaining that voluntary cessation of challenged conduct does not moot a claim). And we are skeptical of the self-defeating notion that the right to the notice necessary to “actually seek habeas relief,” J. G. G., 604 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 3), must itself be vindicated through individual habeas petitions, somehow by plaintiffs who have not received notice.
*  *  *
 The application for an injunction pending further proceedings is granted. The motion for leave to file a supplemental appendix under seal is also granted. Additionally, applicants suggested this Court treat the application as a  petition for a writ of certiorari; doing so, the petition is granted. The judgment of the Fifth Circuit is vacated, and the case is remanded to the Fifth Circuit. In resolving the detainees’ appeal, the Fifth Circuit should address (1) all the normal preliminary injunction factors, including likelihood of success on the merits, as to the named plaintiffs’ underlying habeas claims that the AEA does not authorize their removal pursuant to the President’s March 14, 2025, Proclamation, and (2) the issue of what notice is due, as to the putative class’s due process claims against summary removal. The Government is enjoined from removing the named plaintiffs or putative class members in this action under the AEA pending order by the Fifth Circuit and disposition of the petition for a writ of certiorari, if such writ is timely sought.  Should the petition for a writ of certiorari be denied, this order shall terminate automatically. In the event the petition for a writ of certiorari is granted, the order shall terminate upon the sending down of the judgment of this Court.
 The Government may remove the named plaintiffs or putative class members under other lawful authorities.
It is so ordered.

Notes
1 We note that the District Court recently denied class certification as to the detainees’ underlying habeas claims challenging the validity of removal under the AEA. See ECF Doc. 67. By its own terms, the District Court’s order is “automatically vacated” by our order granting a writ of certiorari. Id., at 2. And in any event, the District Court’s order primarily addressed the detainees’ ability to challenge the validity of AEA removal on a classwide basis. The application before this Court seeks only to vindicate notice rights on a classwide basis. To the extent the District Court’s order addressed due process, see post, at 12 (ALITO, J., dissenting) (citing ECF Doc. 67, pp. 29−31, 33, 38−39), the District Court’s concerns as to the propriety of classwide relief focused on considerations downstream of the initial notice necessary for detainees to raise any substantive claims against AEA removal, see ECF Doc. 67, pp. 29−31, 33, 38−39.

 JUSTICE KAVANAUGH, concurring.
 I understand and agree with the Court’s decision to grant a temporary injunction. The injunction simply ensures that the Judiciary can decide whether these Venezuelan detainees may be lawfully removed under the Alien Enemies Act before they are in fact removed. The underlying legal questions that the courts may need to decide before the removals occur include: (i) whether the Alien Enemies Act (as distinct from the ordinary removal process under the Immigration and Nationality Act) authorizes removal of these detainees and (ii) if so, what notice is due before removal. Several Federal District Courts have already issued conflicting rulings on the underlying legal issues. Compare A. S. R. v. Trump,  No. 3:25–cv–113 (WD Pa., May 13, 2025), with G. F. F. v. Trump, No. 1:25–cv–2886 (SDNY, May 6, 2025), D. B. U. v. Trump, No. 1:25–cv–1163 (D Colo., May 6, 2025), and J. A. V. v. Trump, No. 1:25–cv–72 (SD Tex., May 1, 2025).
 The Executive Branch and the detainees agree about the urgency and importance of those legal questions: The Executive Branch has represented that this case is important for America’s national security and that it is “critical to remove TdA members subject to the Proclamation quickly.” Application To Vacate Orders in Trump v. J. G. G., No. 24A931 (Mar. 28, 2025), p. 37; see Opposition to Emergency Application 3, 5. For their part,  the detainees have explicitly requested that the Court move fast and grant certiorari before judgment. See Reply 4.
 The circumstances call for a prompt and final resolution, which likely can be provided only by this Court. At this juncture, I would prefer not to remand to the lower courts and further put off this Court’s final resolution of the critical legal issues. Rather, consistent with the Executive Branch’s request for expedition—and as the detainees themselves urge—I would grant certiorari, order prompt briefing, hold oral argument soon thereafter, and then resolve the legal issues.

 JUSTICE ALITO, with whom JUSTICE THOMAS joins, dissenting.
 I cannot join the decision of the Court. First and most important, we lack jurisdiction and therefore have no authority to issue any relief. Second, even if we had such authority, the applicants have not satisfied the requirements for the issuance of injunctive relief pending appellate review. Third, granting certiorari before any decision on the merits has been made by either the District Court or the Court of Appeals is unwarranted.
I
A
 “Jurisdiction is power to declare the law,” and “[w]ithout jurisdiction the court cannot proceed at all.” Ex parte McCardle, 7 Wall. 506, 514 (1869). So in order for us to do anything in this matter, “we must assure ourselves that we have jurisdiction.” Abbott v. Perez, 585 U. S. 579, 594 (2018).
 The Court’s theory of jurisdiction, as I understand it, is as follows. Under 28 U. S. C. §1254, we have jurisdiction to review a “case” that is properly before one of the federal courts of appeals. This case was properly before the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit because the two habeas petitioners, A. A. R. P. and W. M. M., took an appeal from a District Court order that refused to issue “an injunction.”  §1292(a)(1). Although the District Court never actually issued such an order or said that it would do so, the District Court constructively denied injunctive relief by failing to act under circumstances where prompt intervention was urgently needed. See ante, at 3.
 This theory rests on a mischaracterization of what happened in the District Court. I do not dispute that a district court’s failure to act expeditiously may, in some circumstances, have “the practical effect of refusing an injunction” and thus entitle a party to take an interlocutory appeal. Carson v. American Brands, Inc., 450 U. S. 79, 84 (1981); see also §1292(a)(1). But that principle does not apply here where (a) the District Court had no good reason to think that either A. A. R. P. or W. M. M. was in imminent danger of removal, (b) the record at that time contained only sketchy evidence about any imminent threat to members of the class of alien detainees they sought to have certified, (c) the court took the entirely reasonable position that it would wait for the Government to respond to the applicants’ request for a temporary restraining order (TRO) before acting, (d) the court set a very short deadline for the filing of the Government’s response, and (e) the court was working diligently on the difficult issues presented by the applicants’ request for relief for themselves and the members of the putative class.
 The Court asserts that the District Court failed to act “for 14 hours and 28 minutes,” ante, at 3, but that is misleading. Here is what actually happened. On the evening of April 17, lawyers for A. A. R. P. and W. M. M. made a phone call in which they demanded “to talk to the Judge immediately . . . and have the Judge issue an order.” Order in No. 1:25–cv–59 (ND Tex., Apr. 21, 2025), ECF Doc. 47–1, p. 2. As the District Court has since correctly noted, judges are generally not permitted to consider such ex parte communications. See ECF Doc. 47, at 1–2 (citing Code of Conduct for Federal Judges, Canon 3(A)(4)); see also Fed. Rule Civ.  Proc. 65(b)(1). So the judge issued an electronic order admonishing the attorneys and stating that “[t]o the extent either party seeks emergency relief, it may file a motion to do so. If an emergency motion is filed, the opposing party shall have 24 hours to file a response.” ECF Doc. 29.
 Thus, when the attorneys for A. A. R. P. and W. M. M. filed their renewed motion for a TRO at 12:34 a.m. on April 18, they were fully aware that the District Court intended to give the Government 24 hours to file a response. But in that motion, the attorneys said nothing about a plan to appeal if the District Court elected to wait for that response.
 It was not until their 12:48 p.m. emergency motion for an immediate status conference that the attorneys suddenly informed the court that they would file an appeal if the District Court did not act within 42 minutes, i.e., by 1:30 p.m. No. 1:25–cv–59 (ND Tex., Apr. 18, 2025), ECF Doc. 34, p. 2. The attorneys then filed their appeal at 3:02 p.m., just 133 minutes after they put the District Court on notice that they would seek appellate relief. Reply 10. Whether or not the actions taken by applicants’ attorneys are thought to be justified under the circumstances, delivering such an ultimatum to a district court judge (“Act on my motion on a complex matter within 42 or 133 minutes or I’ll file an appeal and divest you of jurisdiction”) represented a very stark departure from what is usually regarded as acceptable practice.
 Faced with applicants’ extraordinary demand, the District Court proceeded in an entirely reasonable manner. The Court characterizes the District Court’s behavior during the period in question as “inaction,” ante, at 3, but in my judgment, that is unfair. Rather, as the judge has noted, he “was working with utmost diligence to resolve [the] important and complicated issues [presented by the motion] as quickly as possible.” ECF Doc. 41, p. 4. The judge explained that he had not yet ruled because he could  not “shirk [his] responsibility to decide . . . complicated issues of law without at least some opportunity to review the pleadings and attachments and to get thoughtful responses from the parties.” Id., at 5. And the judge “was prepared to issue an order” “as soon as practicable after the government filed its response shortly after midnight, if not sooner.” Id., at 4.
 We should commend this careful approach, not criticize it. In the past few months alone, we have vacated or stayed district court orders that granted temporary injunctive relief without adequate consideration of the relevant issues. See Trump v. J. G. G., 604 U. S. ___ (2025) (per curiam); Department of Education v. California, 604 U. S. ___ (2025) (per curiam). But in this case, a District Court judge is deemed to have constructively denied an injunction by failing to act within the space of a little over two hours on an application that required consideration of important and difficult questions and that was supported by factual submissions that, as I will explain below, were very weak.
 Under these circumstances, I cannot agree that the District Court’s failure to act amounted to a constructive denial of the applicants’ request for relief.
B
 As I mentioned, the factual support provided to the District Court was weak. The Court claims that the facts presented to the District Court on April 18 showed that there was an emergency entailing a high risk of “serious, perhaps irreparable, consequences.” Ante, at 3 (internal quotation marks omitted). But it is important not to conflate the information that was in the record on April 18 with the new information that was presented to this Court several days later.
 The record that was before the District Court on April 18 (which is the same record that was before us at midnight on that date) included no concrete evidence that any removals  were so imminent that a ruling had to be made immediately. The applicants’ factual support consisted of six sworn declarations and a photograph that the applicants asserted was an image of a notice of removal. See App. to Application 32–37, 56–65. But neither the declarations nor the photograph showed “extreme urgency.” Ante, at 3.
 The declarations certainly did not show that action was urgently needed to protect A. A. R. P. or W. M. M. The Government had represented in District Court that it would not remove either of those men—the only parties who were indisputably before the court—while their habeas petitions were pending. Order in No. 1:25–cv–59 (ND Tex., Apr. 17, 2025), ECF Doc. 27, p. 1. And the two declarations concerning those individuals included no allegations about imminent removal. App. to Application 32–37. Indeed, the declarations concerning them were signed on April 15, prior to the Government’s representation that they would not be removed while their habeas petitions were pending. As a result, the declarations were outdated and provided no support for the claim that either A. A. R. P. or W. M. M. was threatened with removal on April 18 or 19.1
 The remaining evidence in the record at that time concerned only the unnamed members of the as-yet uncertified  class. And of the four declarations concerning those individuals, only one said anything about when removal might happen. In that declaration, a lawyer swore that she spoke on the phone with an unidentified Venezuelan man who said that “ICE had informed them that they will be deported either today or tomorrow to Venezuela.” Id., at 56. In other words, the most specific piece of evidence in the record was a double-hearsay statement that cannot be traced back to any specific government official. Outside of that, none of the remaining declarations said anything about imminent removal. They merely stated that certain aliens were receiving deportation notices, but it was not claimed that these notices specified when removal might occur. See id., at 57–58 (Brané decl.); id., at 59–60 (Collins decl.); id., at 61 (Siegel decl.). And the image of a document labeled “Notice and Warrant of Apprehension and Removal Under the Alien Enemies Act,” which the applicants termed a removal notice, likewise said nothing about the time of removal. See id., at 64–65. Other than these declarations, the court was left with unsupported attorney assertions in the application itself.
 Ignoring these deficiencies in the record before the District Court, the Court relies on information that was not in the District Court record, namely, (a) statements made by a Government attorney in a hearing in another case that was held in Washington, D. C., during the evening on April 18, well after applicants filed their appeal and (b) evidence that we received several days later. See ante, at 2. But in evaluating whether the District Court effectively refused to issue injunctive relief, we must consider the facts as they were known to that court at the time in question.2
  For these reasons, I agree with the unanimous Court of Appeals panel that the District Court did not constructively deny an application for an injunction. As the panel stated, there was no reason to doubt the “diligence and ability” of the District Court to act appropriately under the circumstances. Order in No. 25–10534 (CA5, Apr. 18, 2025), ECF Doc. 14–1, p. 2. And his “failure to issue the requested ruling” within the extraordinarily short period specified by the applicants cannot reasonably be viewed as “an effective denial of injunctive relief.” Id., at 4 (Ramirez, J., concurring).
II
 Even if the District Court had denied the applicants’ motion, there would be no ground for reversal because the applicants failed to satisfy the requirements for emergency injunctive relief, one of which is a showing of likelihood of success on the merits. Nken v. Holder, 556 U. S. 418, 434 (2009). And here, in order to obtain what the application sought (and what the Court now provides)—i.e., relief for the members of the class that applicants asked to have certified—applicants had to show that they were likely to establish that class relief is available in a habeas proceeding and, if such relief is available, that the standard requirements for class certification could likely be met.3
  In my judgment, applicants were not likely to prevail on either of those issues.
A
1
 First, it is doubtful that class relief may be obtained in a habeas proceeding. We have never so held, and it is highly questionable whether it is permitted. Although habeas proceedings are classified as civil, the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure apply only “to the extent that the practice in [habeas] proceedings . . . previously conformed to the practice in civil actions.” Rule 81(a)(4)(B); see also Rule 1. And in accordance with Rule 81, we have acknowledged that some Federal Rules are inapplicable in habeas.
 In Harris v. Nelson, 394 U. S. 286 (1969), for example, we held that Rule 33—concerning interrogatories—does not apply in habeas proceedings because it has no analogue in historical habeas practice and is a poor fit in a habeas proceeding. Id., at 292–298. Among other things, we noted that the prevalence of fact-finding in habeas proceedings was a relatively recent development, and that the specific scope of Rule 33 was “ill-suited to the special problems and character of [habeas] proceedings.” Id., at 296.
 There are similar reasons to believe that Rule 23, which authorizes class actions, is not applicable in habeas. Neither courts nor commentators have found historical support for the practice. One commentator, writing in 1968, noted that “no case has been found in which anything resembling a class action was used in habeas corpus.” Note, Multiparty Federal Habeas Corpus, 81 Harv. L. Rev. 1482, 1493 (1968).  Two years later, another commentator observed that “[c]lass actions for habeas corpus relief have rarely been attempted, perhaps because Rule 81(a)(2) [now Rule 81(a)(4)] seems to bar the application of the civil class action rule to habeas proceedings.” Developments in the Law—Federal Habeas Corpus, 83 Harv. L. Rev. 1038, 1170 (1970) (footnotes omitted). Indeed, there appears to be some historical debate over whether even joinder was permitted in habeas practice. Compare Note, 81 Harv. L. Rev., at 1494 (“The issue of joinder was not explicitly ruled upon in any of these cases, and no case has been found which expressly sanctions the procedure”), with Developments in the Law—Federal Habeas Corpus, 83 Harv. L. Rev., at 1169 (arguing that “the rules on joinder and consolidation apply under even the most restrictive interpretation of Rule 81,” but citing contrary dicta found in at least one case (footnotes omitted)).
2
 Despite this lack of historical support, some lower courts have held that our decision in Harris sometimes permits procedures that resemble those used in a class action. As noted, Harris held that Rule 33, which concerns interrogatories, does not apply in habeas, but the Court also observed that habeas courts “may fashion appropriate modes of procedure, by analogy to existing rules or otherwise in conformity with judicial usage,” when such modes of procedure are necessary to “the habeas corpus jurisdiction and the duty to exercise it.” 394 U. S., at 299. On this ground, Harris held that a habeas court may use its authority under the All Writs Act, 28 U. S. C. §1651, to fashion a procedure resembling an interrogatory to the extent that such an instrument is “needed” by the court to “perform [its] duty” to “summarily hear and determine the facts, and dispose of the matter as law and justice require.” 394 U. S., at 299–300 (internal quotation marks omitted).
 Based on this discussion in Harris, the Second Circuit  held that while Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23 does not itself apply in habeas, “a multi-party proceeding similar to” a Rule 23 class action is sometimes allowed. United States ex rel. Sero v. Preiser, 506 F. 2d 1115, 1125 (CA2 1974). And it concluded that this procedure was appropriate in “the unusual circumstances” present in the case at hand. Ibid.; see also Bijeol v. Benson, 513 F. 2d 965, 968 (CA7 1975).
 This reading of Harris is highly questionable. Where a particular rule does not apply in habeas, a court cannot circumvent that limitation by simply saying that it is importing the same feature under a different rubric. Harris concluded that something like an interrogatory was allowed because it was needed under the circumstances to help the habeas court carry out a duty clearly imposed by law, that is, to “ ‘determine the facts’ ” that are material to the claim made by the petitioner who was before the court. 394 U. S., at 299 (quoting 28 U. S. C. §2243).
 The situation here is different. No provision of law imposes on a habeas court the duty to determine facts or decide legal issues regarding parties who are not before the court. And as a general matter, the class action device is uniquely “ill-suited” for habeas proceedings, id., at 296, which often turn on individualized and fact-specific determinations regarding the confinement of a specific prisoner.
B
 Even if something resembling a class action could be used in a habeas proceeding, it is very questionable whether the requirements for class certification could be met in this case. Rule 23(a)(3) provides that named plaintiffs may sue as representatives of a class “only if,” among other things, “the claims or defenses of the representative parties are typical of the claims or defenses of the class.” And when a court certifies a class, the court is supposed to define the precise “claims” that will be adjudicated on a class-wide basis. See Rule 23(c)(1)(B). That ensures that the only claims  that are adjudicated in a class action are those that the class brings in common and those for which the named plaintiffs are “typical” representatives of the class. See General Telephone Co. of Northwest v. EEOC, 446 U. S. 318, 330 (1980) (“The typicality requirement is said to limit the class claims to those fairly encompassed by the named plaintiff ’s claims”).
 Here, however, the main interim relief sought on behalf of the putative class—adequate notice of plans for removal under the AEA and an opportunity to contest such removal in court, see Application 17–18; Reply 5–7—is not needed by either A. A. R. P. or W. M. M., who already have a pending habeas proceeding and a promise that they will not be removed until that proceeding concludes. For this reason, their situation differs critically from that of many of the putative class members since they have no personal stake in how the court resolves the question of interim relief for the putative class members.
 The Court responds to this problem by suggesting that a class action defendant may not “defeat class treatment, if it is otherwise proper, by promising as a matter of grace to treat named plaintiffs differently.” Ante, at 7 (emphasis added). But the Court provides no analysis suggesting that class certification here is “otherwise proper,” and instead asserts that it can ignore the question of class certification at this preliminary stage. Ibid. And, in any event, the record does not suggest that the Government is treating the named plaintiffs differently “as a matter of grace.” Ibid. Rather, it is doing so pursuant to its general policy against removing AEA detainees when they have a pending habeas petition. See Opposition to Emergency Application 2 (“the government has agreed not to remove pursuant [to] the AEA those AEA detainees who do file habeas claims”).
C
 We have told district courts that they may certify a class  only after conducting a “ ‘rigorous analysis’ ” of the question. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v. Dukes, 564 U. S. 338, 351 (2011) (quoting General Telephone Co. of Southwest v. Falcon, 457 U. S. 147, 161 (1982)). On April 18, the District Court had no time to engage in such analysis, and as a result, it cannot be said that the court abused its discretion in failing to conclude that applicants’ were likely to prevail on their class-action arguments. Cf. University of Tex. v. Camenisch, 451 U. S. 390, 393–394 (1981).
 The District Court has since had time to conduct the “rigorous analysis” that our precedents require, and has concluded that class certification would be improper here. Order in No. 1:25–cv–59 (ND Tex., May 9, 2025), ECF Doc. 67. That development makes the relief issued by the Court today all the more extraordinary. Purporting to exercise its appellate jurisdiction, the Court issues “preliminary relief ” to a putative class that the District Court has explicitly refused to certify, and it does so without providing any substantive analysis suggesting that the District Court’s analysis of the class certification issue was incorrect.
 Instead of substantively engaging with the District Court’s order, the Court asserts that the order makes no difference because it “primarily addressed the detainees’ ability to challenge the validity of AEA removal on a classwide basis,” whereas “[t]he application before this Court seeks only to vindicate notice rights.” Ante, at 6, n. *. But the District Court’s order did address the notice question. In addition to explaining why the applicants cannot pursue their final merits claims as a class action, the order explains at length why the applicants’ claims regarding notice rights also cannot proceed on a class basis. ECF Doc. 67, at 29–31, 33, 38–39. Among other things, the District Court observed that “due process is by its very nature individualized,” id., at 33, a proposition plainly supported by our precedents. See Jennings v. Rodriguez, 583 U. S. 281, 314  (2018) (“Due process is flexible, we have stressed repeatedly, and it calls for such procedural protections as the particular situation demands” (internal quotation marks and alteration omitted)).
 In any event, the District Court also offered several general reasons why class relief would be inappropriate here, and these apply equally to the applicants’ claims regarding notice rights. See ECF Doc. 67, at 35–36, 39–45. The Court today issues temporary relief without engaging with any of that analysis. And, what’s more, it asks the Fifth Circuit to finally adjudicate the notice rights of members of the putative class without asking that court to do its own analysis regarding whether class certification as to those claims would be appropriate. Ante, at 8. Clearly, the Court would prefer to ignore the important step of class certification and skip directly to the adjudication of the class members’ rights. The Federal Rules do not permit such a shortcut.
III
 Instead of merely ruling on the application that is before us—which asks for emergency relief pending appeal—the Court takes the unusual step of granting certiorari before judgment, summarily vacating the judgment below dismissing the applicants’ appeal, and remanding the case to the Court of Appeals with directions regarding the issues that court should address. From the Court’s order, it is not entirely clear whether the Court has silently decided issues that go beyond the question of interim relief. (I certainly hope that it has not.) But if it has done so, today’s order is doubly extraordinary. Granting certiorari before a court of appeals has entered a judgment is a sharp departure from usual practice, but here neither the Court of Appeals nor the District Court has decided any merits questions.
 We have said more times than I care to remember that “we are a court of review, not first view.” Cutter v. Wilkinson, 544 U. S. 709, 718, n. 7 (2005). Even on the Court’s  reading of what happened below, all that the District Court and the Court of Appeals decided was that the applicants were not entitled to temporary injunctive relief. If the Court has gone beyond that question, it has blazed a new trail. It has plucked a case from a district court and decided important issues in the first instance. To my eyes, that looks far too much like an expansion of our original jurisdiction.
 I must therefore respectfully dissent.
________________________________________
Notes
1  The Government “unequivocally” told the District Court that it did not “ ‘presently expect to remove A.A.R.P. or W.M.M. under the [Alien Enemies Act (AEA)] until after the pending habeas petition is resolved,’ ” and that it would “ ‘update’ ” the District Court if that changed. ECF Doc. 27, at 1. And in their application for relief before this Court, the applicants did not assert that A. A. R. P. or W. M. M. in particular were at risk of being removed. To the contrary, the applicants represented that they had contacted the Government and were told that “the two named Applicants had not been given [removal] notices.” Application 5, n. 3. The Government later confirmed in its filings before this Court that it “has agreed not to remove pursuant [to] the AEA those AEA detainees who do file habeas claims,” including the named applicants. Opposition to Emergency Application 2.
2  Moreover, it appears to me that the Court overstates what the Government attorney actually said during the April 18 hearing. The attorney represented that it was “definitive” that “there are no flights tonight,” and that “the people [he] spoke to were not aware of any plans for flights tomorrow.” Tr. of Proceedings in J. G. G. v. Trump, ECF Doc. 93, p. 15. Although the attorney also said that the Department of Homeland Security “reserve[d] the right to remove people tomorrow,” he repeated numerous times that no flights were planned for April 19. Id., at 26; see also id., at 9, 15, 29–30. The attorney’s statements showed that there was a possibility of future injury but not that such an injury was certainly impending. Clapper v. Amnesty Int’l, USA, 568 U. S. 398, 410 (2013).
3  The Court asserts that “courts may issue temporary relief to a putative class” without “decid[ing] whether a class should be certified.” Ante, at 7. In support of that proposition, the Court cites to no precedent of this Court. Instead, it cites to a treatise that provides no substantive reasoning in support of the proposition. See ibid. (citing 2 W. Rubenstein, Newberg & Rubenstein on Class Actions §4:30 (6th ed. 2022 and Supp. 2024). Even if the Court were correct, its position would not justify its decision to entirely sidestep the issue of certification. A court considering whether to issue preliminary injunctive relief must consider whether the movant is likely to succeed on the merits. And to consider whether a request for classwide relief is likely to succeed on the merits, a court must at least consider whether class certification is likely.



رئیس جمهور با استناد به قانون دشمنان بیگانه (AEA)، بخش 4067 از مجموعه 50 قانون ایالات متحده آمریکا، بخش 21، اتباع ونزوئلایی عضو ترن د آراگوا (TdA)، یک سازمان تروریستی خارجی تعیین شده، را از کشور اخراج کرده است. به اعلامیه ریاست جمهوری شماره 10903، 90 قانون فدرال ثبت شده 13033 (2025) مراجعه کنید. متقاضیان، دو بازداشتی هستند که به عنوان اعضای TdA شناسایی شده‌اند و یک طبقه فرضی از بازداشت‌شدگان با وضعیت مشابه در ناحیه شمالی تگزاس. همه اعضای ادعایی TdA در طبقه فرضی در حال حاضر در بازداشتگاه‌های ایالات متحده نگهداری می‌شوند. در دادخواست ارائه شده به دادگاه، بازداشت‌شدگان خواستار حکم منع موقت علیه اخراج فوری تحت AEA هستند.


در 17 آوریل 2025، دادگاه ناحیه درخواست بازداشت‌شدگان برای صدور حکم منع موقت (TRO) علیه اخراج فوری تحت AEA را رد کرد. شماره ۲۵-cv-59، سند ECF 27. بازداشت‌شدگان ادعا می‌کنند که ساعاتی بعد، به اعضای فرضی گروه اخطاریه‌هایی مبنی بر اخراج از AEA ابلاغ شده و به آنها گفته شده که «امشب یا فردا» اخراج خواهند شد. سند ECF 30، صفحه ۱. در ۱۸ آوریل، ساعت ۱۲:۳۴ بامداد به وقت مرکزی، بازداشت‌شدگان برای یک جلسه استماع اضطراری (TRO) مراجعه کردند. به همانجا مراجعه کنید. در ساعت ۱۲:۴۸ بعد از ظهر، بازداشت‌شدگان برای صدور حکم در مورد آن درخواست یا تشکیل جلسه استماع وضعیت تا ساعت ۱:۳۰ بعد از ظهر مراجعه کردند. سند ECF 34. در ساعت ۳:۰۲ بعد از ظهر، آنها از «رد سازنده» TRO اضطراری به حوزه قضایی پنجم شکایت کردند. سند ECF 36، صفحه ۱. بازداشت‌شدگان همچنین برای صدور حکم موقت به این دادگاه درخواست دادند.


ما متوجه شدیم که دولت حق خود را برای انتقال بازداشت‌شدگان به محض نیمه‌شب به وقت مرکزی در ۱۹ آوریل اعلام کرده است. دولت در ۱۸ آوریل تنها در جلسه استماع عصرگاهی دادگاه ناحیه کلمبیا، جایی که بازداشت‌شدگان به‌طور جداگانه درخواست کمک کرده بودند، به ادعاهای بازداشت‌شدگان رسیدگی کرد. دولت تضمین کرد که هیچ یک از اعضای فرضی گروه در آن روز منتقل نخواهند شد. TR. of Proceedings in J. G. G. v. Trump, No. 25−cv−766, ECF Doc. 93, p. 9. اما همچنین اظهار داشت که از نظر آن، انتقال اعضای فرضی گروه به محض روز بعد «با» تعهدات دادرسی آن سازگار خواهد بود و «حق» انجام چنین اقدامی را برای خود محفوظ می‌دارد. همان، صفحه ۲۶؛ به همان، صفحه ۱۶ مراجعه کنید (توضیح دادگاه مبنی بر اینکه «فردا... از ساعت ۱۲:۰۱ بامداد شروع می‌شود»). شواهد موجود در پرونده (اگرچه همه آنها در 18 آوریل در دسترس ما نبود) نشان می‌دهد که دولت در واقع بعدازظهر 18 آوریل اقداماتی را برای انتقال بازداشت‌شدگان تحت قانون AEA انجام داده بود - از جمله انتقال آنها از بازداشتگاهشان به فرودگاه و سپس بازگرداندن آنها به بازداشتگاه. به ضمیمه پاسخ 1a-5a مراجعه کنید. اگر بازداشت‌شدگان در 19 آوریل از ایالات متحده به بازداشتگاه یک کشور خارجی منتقل می‌شدند، دولت ممکن بود همانطور که قبلاً استدلال کرده بود، استدلال کند که هیچ دادگاه آمریکایی صلاحیت صدور حکم تخفیف را ندارد. به درخواست تخلیه در پرونده Noem v. Abrego Garcia، شماره 24A949 (7 آوریل 2025)، صفحات 11-20 مراجعه کنید.


ساعت 12:52 بامداد به وقت شرقی (11:52 شب به وقت مرکزی)، ما به دولت دستور دادیم - با توجه به همه این شرایط - "هیچ یک از اعضای طبقه فرضی بازداشت‌شدگان را منتقل نکند" تا صلاحیت ما برای بررسی درخواست حفظ شود. 604 U. S. ___ (2025). ما از دولت دعوت کردیم تا پس از صدور رأی دادگاه حوزه پنجم، به آن درخواست پاسخ دهد. دادگاه حوزه پنجم، درخواست تجدیدنظر بازداشت‌شدگان را به دلیل عدم صلاحیت رد کرد و درخواست آنها برای صدور حکم موقت در انتظار تجدیدنظر را زودهنگام دانست، به این دلیل که بازداشت‌شدگان "فقط 42 دقیقه به دادگاه [ناحیه] فرصت اقدام دادند." شماره 25-10534، ECF Doc. 14، صفحه 2. اکنون این درخواست را به عنوان دادخواستی برای صدور حکم موقت از تصمیم دادگاه حوزه پنجم تفسیر می‌کنیم. به پاسخ 15 مراجعه کنید. ما این دادخواست و همچنین درخواست صدور حکم موقت در انتظار رسیدگی بیشتر را می‌پذیریم، حکم دادگاه حوزه پنجم را لغو می‌کنیم و برای رسیدگی بیشتر به دادگاه حوزه پنجم ارجاع می‌دهیم.

II

دادگاه حوزه پنجم در رد درخواست تجدیدنظر بازداشت‌شدگان به دلیل عدم صلاحیت اشتباه کرد. دادگاه‌های تجدیدنظر صلاحیت بررسی احکام موقت را دارند که "اثر عملی رد حکم موقت" را دارند. کارسون علیه شرکت برندهای آمریکایی، 450 U. S. 79, 84 (1981). عدم اقدام دادگاه منطقه‌ای در مواجهه با فوریت شدید و خطر بالای عواقب "جدی، شاید جبران‌ناپذیر"، ممکن است منجر به رد حکم شود. 16 C. Wright, A. Miller, & E. Cooper, Federal Practice and Procedure §3924.1, pp. 174, 180-181 (ویرایش سوم 2012) (به نقل از Baltimore Contractors, Inc. v. Bodinger, 348 U. S. 176, 181 (1955)). در اینجا، عدم اقدام دادگاه منطقه‌ای - نه به مدت 42 دقیقه، بلکه به مدت 14 ساعت و 28 دقیقه - نتیجه عملی رد حکم برای بازداشت‌شدگانی که با تهدید قریب‌الوقوع آسیب شدید و جبران‌ناپذیر مواجه بودند، داشت. بر این اساس، ما حکم دادگاه تجدیدنظر را باطل اعلام می‌کنیم. «[متمم پنجم قانون اساسی] بیگانگان را در چارچوب مراحل اخراج، از روند قانونی برخوردار می‌کند.» ترامپ علیه جی. جی. جی.، 604 U. S. ___, ___ (2025) (طبق متن اصلی) (اسناد، صفحه 3) (علامت نقل قول داخلی حذف شده است). «قوانین دادرسی رویه‌ای برای محافظت» در برابر «محرومیت اشتباه یا غیرموجه از زندگی، آزادی یا اموال» در نظر گرفته شده‌اند. کری علیه پیفوس،435 U. S. 247, 259 (1978). ما مدت‌هاست که معتقدیم «هیچ شخصی نباید» از ایالات متحده «بدون فرصت، در زمانی، برای شنیدن اظهاراتش» اخراج شود. پرونده مهاجران ژاپنی، 189 U. S. 86, 101 (1903). روند دادرسی مستلزم ابلاغیه‌ای است که «تحت هر شرایطی به طور معقول محاسبه شده باشد تا طرفین ذینفع را مطلع کند» و «زمان معقولی را برای حضور [در دادگاه] فراهم کند.» Mullane v. Central Hanover Bank & Trust Co.، 339 U. S. 306, 314 (1950). بر این اساس، در J. G. G.، این دادگاه - با موافقت هر نه قاضی - توضیح داد که «بازداشت‌شدگان AEA باید قبل از اخراج، اخطاریه‌ای دریافت کنند... مبنی بر اینکه طبق قانون... در معرض اخراج هستند... در یک زمان معقول و به گونه‌ای که به آنها اجازه دهد واقعاً درخواست حکم آزادی به دلیل [قرار احضار به دادگاه] کنند». 604 U. S.، در ____ (اسکناس، در 3). برای اینکه یک بازداشت‌شده «واقعاً درخواست حکم آزادی مشروط» کند، باید زمان و اطلاعات کافی داشته باشد تا بتواند به طور معقول با وکیل تماس بگیرد، دادخواست ارائه دهد و درخواست کمک مناسب را پیگیری کند.

دولت در این دادگاه به توضیحات متقاضیان در مورد اخطاریه ارائه شده به بازداشت‌شدگان AEA در ناحیه شمالی تگزاس و همچنین به این ادعا که دولت آماده بود تا به زودی اخراج‌ها را انجام دهد، اعتراضی نمی‌کند. دولت در جای دیگری اظهار داشته است که قادر به بازگرداندن فردی که به اشتباه به زندانی در السالوادور تبعید شده است، نیست، به پرونده Abrego Garcia v. Noem، شماره 25-cv-951 (D Md.)، اسناد ECF 74، 77 مراجعه کنید، که در آن ادعا می‌شود بازداشت‌شدگان با بازداشت نامحدود روبرو هستند، به درخواست دستور موقت 11 مراجعه کنید. بر این اساس، منافع بازداشت‌شدگان به ویژه قابل توجه است. تحت این شرایط، اطلاع‌رسانی تقریباً ۲۴ ساعت قبل از اخراج، بدون ارائه اطلاعات در مورد نحوه اعمال حقوق دادرسی برای اعتراض به آن اخراج، مطمئناً مورد قبول واقع نمی‌شود. اما برای این دادگاه، که از شرایط موجود بسیار دور است، مطلوب نیست که در وهله اول فرآیند دقیق لازم برای رعایت قانون اساسی در این پرونده را تعیین کند. ما پرونده را برای این منظور به حوزه پنجم قضایی ارجاع می‌دهیم.

برای روشن شدن موضوع، ما امروز فقط تصمیم می‌گیریم که بازداشت‌شدگان حق دریافت اطلاع‌رسانی بیشتری نسبت به آنچه در ۱۸ آوریل داده شد، دارند و ما برای حفظ صلاحیت خود در حالی که سوال مربوط به اینکه چه اطلاع‌رسانی باید انجام شود، رسیدگی می‌شود، حکم منع موقت صادر می‌کنیم. به پست ۱۳ (ALITO, J., مخالف) مراجعه کنید. ما در ۱۹ آوریل - و اکنون نیز - به شایستگی‌های اساسی ادعاهای طرفین در مورد قانونی بودن اخراج‌ها تحت AEA نپرداختیم. ما اهمیت منافع امنیت ملی دولت و همچنین ضرورت پیگیری چنین منافعی را به شیوه‌ای سازگار با قانون اساسی تشخیص می‌دهیم. با توجه به موارد فوق، دادگاه‌های بدوی باید به سرعت به پرونده‌های AEA رسیدگی کنند.

III
رأی مخالف، هم صلاحیت دادگاه و هم در دسترس بودن درخواست‌های جبران خسارت برای همه طبقات را مورد اختلاف قرار می‌دهد. ما استدلال آن را قانع‌کننده نمی‌دانیم.

اولاً، توصیف رأی مخالف از وقایع رخ داده در ۱۸ آوریل را که منجر به زیر سوال رفتن صلاحیت ما شده است، رد می‌کنیم. دادگاه‌های ناحیه باید با دقت و ملاحظه به درخواست‌های جبران خسارت مقدماتی رسیدگی کنند، به پست ۳-۴ (ALITO, J.، مخالف) مراجعه کنید، اما شرایط بحرانی ممکن است محدودیت‌های عملی ایجاد کند. درخواست جبران خسارت مقدماتی «معمولاً بر اساس رویه‌هایی که رسمیت کمتری دارند و شواهدی که نسبت به محاکمه بر اساس ماهیت، ناقص‌تر هستند، اعطا می‌شود.» لاکی علیه استینی، 604 U. S. ___, ___ (2025) (اسلیپ‌آپ، صفحه 6) (به نقل از دانشگاه تگزاس علیه کامنیش، 451 U. S. 390, 395 (1981)). هدف از چنین قراری «صرفاً حفظ موقعیت نسبی طرفین» در انتظار رسیدگی‌های بعدی است. لاکی، 604 U. S.، صفحه ___ (اسلیپ‌آپ، صفحه 6) (به نقل از کامنیش، 451 U. S.، صفحه 395). 
در این پرونده، سوابق موجود در دادگاه منطقه‌ای، اگرچه محدود بود، نشان می‌داد که اخراج اعضای فرضی گروه احتمالاً قریب‌الوقوع است. Contra, post, صفحه 4-6 (ALITO, J., مخالف). بازداشت‌شدگان چهار اعلامیه به درخواست اضطراری خود برای TRO پیوست کردند. برای مثال، در یکی از آنها، وکیلی گزارش یک بازداشتی را مبنی بر اینکه مأموران مهاجرت «به آنها اطلاع داده‌اند که امروز یا فردا اخراج خواهند شد» منتقل کرد. سند ECF، شماره 30-1. در سند دوم، یک مدیر غیرانتفاعی مکالماتی را با اعضای خانواده بازداشت‌شدگان و مرتبط با ویدئویی از بازداشت‌شدگان که اخطار اخراج را در دست داشتند، به عنوان مدرکی مبنی بر اینکه بازداشت‌شدگان «در حال اخراج بودند» توصیف کرد. سند ECF، شماره 30-2. 
نکته مهم این است که سوال مرتبط با اهداف حوزه قضایی ما این است که آیا در زمانی که از این دادگاه خواسته شد تا مداخله کند، عدم اقدام دادگاه منطقه‌ای منجر به رد حکم منع تعقیب شده است یا خیر. بازداشت‌شدگان در درخواست خود به این دادگاه اظهار داشتند که «[بسیاری از] افراد قبلاً سوار اتوبوس‌ها شده بودند که احتمالاً به سمت فرودگاه می‌رفتند.» درخواست حکم منع تعقیب 1. اندکی پس از آن، دولت در دادگاه فدرال اظهار داشت که حق اخراج بازداشت‌شدگان را پس از نیمه‌شب برای خود محفوظ می‌دارد. ما این اختیار را داشتیم که برای جلوگیری از آسیب جبران‌ناپذیر به متقاضیان و حفظ صلاحیت قضایی خود، قرار منع تعقیب صادر کنیم.رسیدگی قضایی در مورد این موضوع. 28 U. S. C. §1651(a). اکنون که دادگاه حوزه پنجم حکم داده است، صلاحیت قضایی ما نیز از بررسی در روند عادی پشتیبانی می‌کند. 
در نهایت، این دادگاه می‌تواند به درستی دستور موقت برای گروه فرضی صادر کند تا صلاحیت ما در انتظار تجدیدنظر حفظ شود.1 متقاضیان نامبرده A. A. R. P. و W. M. M. ادعا می‌کنند که در معرض خطر قریب‌الوقوع طبقه‌بندی به عنوان دشمن بیگانه و اخراج از ایالات متحده هستند، اما سوابق نشان نمی‌دهد که آنها هیچ اخطار رسمی مبنی بر اخراج تحت AEA دریافت کرده‌اند. به ECF Doc. 38، صفحات 5-6 مراجعه کنید. متقاضیان نامبرده، به همراه اعضای گروه فرضی، حق دارند قبل از هرگونه اخراج، اخطار کافی از نظر قانون اساسی دریافت کنند تا بتوانند درخواست غرامت مناسب را پیگیری کنند. اگرچه اعضای گروه فرضی در نهایت ممکن است در پاسخ به چنین اخطاری، اقدامات متفاوتی را برای محافظت از منافع خود انجام دهند، اخطاری که حق دریافت آن را دارند، یکسان است. و از آنجا که دادگاه‌ها می‌توانند به یک گروه فرضی، حکم موقت صادر کنند، به 2 W. Rubenstein, Newberg & Rubenstein در مورد دعاوی دسته‌جمعی §4:30 (ویرایش ششم 2022 و ضمیمه 2024) مراجعه کنید، نیازی نیست تصمیم بگیریم که آیا یک گروه باید در مورد ادعاهای مربوط به روند قانونی بازداشت‌شدگان گواهی شود تا بتوانیم دولت را به طور موقت از حذف اعضای دسته‌جمعی فرضی در حالی که سوال در مورد اینکه چه اطلاعیه‌ای باید صادر شود، منع کنیم.

ما تصدیق می‌کنیم که دولت "موافقت کرده است که از حذف شاکیان نامبرده طبق AEA در حالی که مراحل احضار آنها در حال بررسی است، صرف نظر کند." مخالفت با درخواست اضطراری 11. اما ما این پیشنهاد را رد می‌کنیم که یک متهم در یک دعوای دسته‌جمعی می‌تواند با وعده دادن به عنوان یک امر لطف‌آمیز برای رفتار متفاوت با شاکیان نامبرده، در صورت مناسب بودن، رفتار دسته‌جمعی را شکست دهد. رجوع کنید به FBI v. Fikre, 601 U. S. 234, 241 (2024) (توضیح اینکه توقف داوطلبانه رفتار مورد اعتراض، ادعایی را منتفی نمی‌کند). و ما نسبت به این تصور خود-ویرانگر که حق دریافت اخطار لازم برای «درخواست واقعی آزادی مشروط» (J. G. G., 604 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 3)) باید خود از طریق دادخواست‌های انفرادی آزادی مشروط، به نحوی توسط شاکیانی که اخطار دریافت نکرده‌اند، تأیید شود، تردید داریم.

*  *  *
درخواست صدور حکم موقت تا زمان رسیدگی بیشتر پذیرفته می‌شود. درخواست اجازه برای ثبت ضمیمه تکمیلی تحت مهر و موم نیز پذیرفته می‌شود. علاوه بر این، متقاضیان پیشنهاد کردند که این دادگاه این درخواست را به عنوان دادخواستی برای حکم جلب تلقی کند. با انجام این کار، دادخواست پذیرفته می‌شود. حکم دادگاه حوزه پنجم لغو و پرونده به حوزه پنجم ارجاع داده می‌شود. در حل و فصل درخواست تجدیدنظر بازداشت‌شدگان، دادگاه حوزه پنجم باید (1) تمام عوامل دستور مقدماتی معمول، از جمله احتمال موفقیت در رسیدگی به اصل دعوی، در مورد ادعاهای مربوط به حکم آزادی مشروط شاکیان نامبرده مبنی بر اینکه AEA اجازه اخراج آنها را طبق اعلامیه 14 مارس 2025 رئیس جمهور نمی‌دهد، و (2) موضوع ابلاغیه مربوطه، در مورد ادعاهای مربوط به روند دادرسی گروه فرضی علیه اخراج فوری را مورد توجه قرار دهد. دولت موظف است شاکیان نامبرده یا اعضای گروه فرضی را در این دعوی تحت دستور در حال بررسی AEA توسط دادگاه حوزه پنجم و در صورت درخواست به موقع برای صدور حکم بازداشت، حذف کند. در صورت رد درخواست صدور حکم بازداشت، این دستور به طور خودکار خاتمه می‌یابد. در صورت پذیرش درخواست صدور حکم بازداشت، دستور پس از صدور حکم این دادگاه خاتمه می‌یابد.


دولت می‌تواند شاکیان نامبرده یا اعضای گروه فرضی را تحت سایر مراجع قانونی حذف کند. چنین دستوری داده شده است.

یادداشت‌ها
1 ما متوجه هستیم که دادگاه ناحیه اخیراً گواهی کلاسی مربوط به ادعاهای مربوط به آزادی مشروط بازداشت‌شدگان که اعتبار اخراج تحت AEA را به چالش می‌کشد، رد کرده است. به سند ECF 67 مراجعه کنید. طبق مفاد خود، دستور دادگاه ناحیه با دستور ما مبنی بر اعطای حکم بازداشت "به طور خودکار لغو می‌شود". همان، صفحه 2. و در هر صورت، دستور دادگاه ناحیه در درجه اول به توانایی بازداشت‌شدگان برای به چالش کشیدن اعتبار اخراج AEA در سطح کلاسی می‌پردازد. درخواست ارائه شده به این دادگاه فقط به دنبال اثبات حقوق اخطار در سطح کلاسی است. تا جایی که حکم دادگاه ناحیه به روند دادرسی پرداخته است، به پست، در 12 (ALITO, J.، مخالف) (با استناد به سند ECF 67، صفحات 29-31، 33، 38-39)، نگرانی‌های دادگاه ناحیه در مورد مناسب بودن تخفیف در سطح کلاس، بر ملاحظاتی در پایین‌دست اخطار اولیه لازم برای بازداشت‌شدگان جهت طرح هرگونه ادعای اساسی علیه حذف AEA متمرکز بود، به سند ECF 67، صفحات 29-31، 33، 38-39 مراجعه کنید.

_________________________________________
قاضی کاوانا، موافق.
من تصمیم دادگاه مبنی بر اعطای حکم را درک کرده و با آن موافقم.دستور موقت. این دستور به سادگی تضمین می‌کند که قوه قضائیه می‌تواند تصمیم بگیرد که آیا این بازداشت‌شدگان ونزوئلایی می‌توانند طبق قانون دشمنان بیگانه، قبل از اینکه واقعاً اخراج شوند، به طور قانونی اخراج شوند یا خیر. سوالات حقوقی اساسی که دادگاه‌ها ممکن است قبل از انجام اخراج‌ها باید به آنها پاسخ دهند عبارتند از: (۱) آیا قانون دشمنان بیگانه (که متمایز از فرآیند اخراج عادی تحت قانون مهاجرت و ملیت است) اجازه اخراج این بازداشت‌شدگان را می‌دهد و (۲) اگر چنین است، چه اطلاعی قبل از اخراج باید داده شود. چندین دادگاه فدرال منطقه‌ای پیش از این احکام متناقضی در مورد مسائل حقوقی اساسی صادر کرده‌اند. پرونده A. S. R. علیه ترامپ، شماره 3:25–cv–113 (دادگاه ایالتی پنسیلوانیا، 13 مه 2025)، را با پرونده G. F. F. علیه ترامپ، شماره 1:25–cv–2886 (دادگاه ایالتی نیویورک، 6 مه 2025)، پرونده D. B. U. علیه ترامپ، شماره 1:25–cv–1163 (دادگاه ایالتی کلرادو، 6 مه 2025) و پرونده J. A. V. علیه ترامپ، شماره 1:25–cv–72 (دادگاه ایالتی تگزاس، 1 مه 2025) مقایسه کنید.


قوه مجریه و بازداشت‌شدگان در مورد فوریت و اهمیت این سوالات حقوقی اتفاق نظر دارند: قوه مجریه اعلام کرده است که این پرونده برای امنیت ملی آمریکا مهم است و «اخراج سریع اعضای TdA مشمول اعلامیه بسیار مهم است». درخواست لغو دستور در پرونده ترامپ علیه جی. جی. جی.، شماره 24A931 (28 مارس 2025)، صفحه 37؛ به مخالفت با درخواست اضطراری 3، 5 مراجعه کنید. از طرف خود، بازداشت‌شدگان صراحتاً درخواست کرده‌اند که دادگاه سریعاً اقدام کند و قبل از صدور حکم، حکم غیابی صادر کند. به پاسخ 4 مراجعه کنید.

شرایط، حل و فصل سریع و نهایی را می‌طلبد که احتمالاً فقط توسط این دادگاه قابل ارائه است. در این برهه، ترجیح می‌دهم پرونده را به دادگاه‌های پایین‌تر ارجاع ندهم و حل و فصل نهایی این دادگاه در مورد مسائل حقوقی حیاتی را بیش از این به تعویق نیندازم. در عوض، مطابق با درخواست قوه مجریه برای اعزام - و همانطور که خود بازداشت‌شدگان اصرار دارند - حکم غیابی صادر می‌کنم، دستور جلسه توجیهی فوری می‌دهم، بلافاصله پس از آن جلسه شفاهی برگزار می‌کنم و سپس مسائل حقوقی را حل و فصل می‌کنم.

در مورد درخواست صدور قرار منع تعقیب
_________________________________________
[16 مه 2025]
_________________________________________
قاضی آلیتو، که قاضی توماس به او می‌پیوندد، مخالف است. 
من نمی‌توانم به تصمیم دادگاه بپیوندم. اول و مهمتر از همه، ما فاقد صلاحیت قضایی هستیم و بنابراین هیچ اختیاری برای صدور قرار منع تعقیب نداریم. دوم، حتی اگر چنین اختیاری داشتیم، متقاضیان الزامات صدور قرار منع تعقیب را تا زمان بررسی تجدیدنظر برآورده نکرده‌اند. سوم، اعطای گواهی عدم سوءپیشینه قبل از هرگونه تصمیم در مورد ماهیت توسط دادگاه بدوی یا دادگاه تجدیدنظر بی‌اساس است.
I
A
«صلاحیت قضایی، قدرت اعلام قانون است» و «بدون صلاحیت، دادگاه به هیچ وجه نمی‌تواند رسیدگی کند.» Ex parte McCardle, 7 Wall. 506, 514 (1869). بنابراین برای اینکه بتوانیم در این مورد کاری انجام دهیم، «باید مطمئن شویم که صلاحیت قضایی داریم.» Abbott v. Perez, 585 U. S. 579, 594 (2018). 
نظریه صلاحیت قضایی دادگاه، آنطور که من متوجه شده‌ام، به شرح زیر است. طبق ماده 1254 از قانون 28 U. S. C.، ما صلاحیت بررسی «پرونده‌ای» را داریم که به طور صحیح در یکی از دادگاه‌های تجدیدنظر فدرال مطرح شده است. این پرونده به طور صحیح در دادگاه تجدیدنظر حوزه پنجم مطرح شده بود زیرا دو شاکیِ قرار احضار به دادگاه، A. A. R. P. و W. M. M.، از حکم دادگاه ناحیه‌ای که از صدور «حکم منع» خودداری کرده بود، تجدیدنظرخواهی کردند. ماده 1292(a)(1). اگرچه دادگاه ناحیه هرگز چنین حکمی را صادر نکرد یا نگفت که این کار را خواهد کرد، اما دادگاه ناحیه با عدم اقدام در شرایطی که مداخله فوری ضروری بود، به طور سازنده حکم منع تعقیب را رد کرد. به بخش قبل، صفحه 3 مراجعه کنید.

این نظریه مبتنی بر توصیف نادرست از آنچه در دادگاه ناحیه اتفاق افتاده است، می‌باشد. من بحثی ندارم که عدم اقدام سریع دادگاه ناحیه ممکن است در برخی شرایط، "اثر عملی رد حکم منع تعقیب" را داشته باشد و بنابراین به یکی از طرفین حق درخواست تجدیدنظر موقت را بدهد. Carson v. American Brands, Inc., 450 U. S. 79, 84 (1981)؛ همچنین به §1292(a)(1) مراجعه کنید. اما این اصل در اینجا اعمال نمی‌شود، جایی که (الف) دادگاه منطقه‌ای هیچ دلیل خوبی برای این فکر نداشت که A. A. R. P. یا W. M. M. در خطر قریب‌الوقوع اخراج قرار دارند، (ب) پرونده در آن زمان فقط شامل شواهد ناقصی در مورد هرگونه تهدید قریب‌الوقوع برای اعضای طبقه بازداشت‌شدگان خارجی بود که آنها به دنبال تأیید آن بودند، (ج) دادگاه موضع کاملاً معقولی اتخاذ کرد که منتظر پاسخ دولت به درخواست متقاضیان برای دستور منع موقت (TRO) قبل از اقدام خواهد بود، (د) دادگاه مهلت بسیار کوتاهی برای ارائه پاسخ دولت تعیین کرد، و (ه) دادگاه با جدیت روی مسائل دشوار ارائه شده توسط درخواست متقاضیان برای کمک به خود و اعضای طبقه فرضی کار می‌کرد.


دادگاه ادعا می‌کند که دادگاه منطقه‌ای "به مدت 14 ساعت و 28 دقیقه" قبل از، در 3 اقدام نکرده است، اما این گمراه‌کننده است. در اینجااین چیزی است که واقعاً اتفاق افتاد. عصر 17 آوریل، وکلای A. A. R. P. و W. M. M. تماس تلفنی برقرار کردند و در آن خواستار «صحبت فوری با قاضی... و صدور حکم از قاضی» شدند. حکم در شماره 1:25–cv–59 (ND Tex.، 21 آوریل 2025)، ECF Doc. 47–1، صفحه 2. همانطور که دادگاه منطقه‌ای از آن زمان به درستی اشاره کرده است، قضات عموماً مجاز به بررسی چنین ارتباطات یک‌طرفه‌ای نیستند. به ECF Doc. 47، صفحات 1–2 (با استناد به آیین‌نامه رفتار قضات فدرال، قانون 3(A)(4)) مراجعه کنید؛ همچنین به Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 65(b)(1) مراجعه کنید. بنابراین قاضی یک دستور الکترونیکی صادر کرد که در آن به وکلا تذکر داده شده بود و بیان شده بود که «تا جایی که هر یک از طرفین درخواست کمک اضطراری می‌کند، می‌تواند درخواست خود را ارائه دهد. در صورت ارائه درخواست اضطراری، طرف مقابل ۲۴ ساعت فرصت دارد تا پاسخ خود را ارائه دهد.» سند ۲۹ ECF.
بنابراین، هنگامی که وکلای A. A. R. P. و W. M. M. درخواست تجدید نظر خود را برای TRO در ساعت ۱۲:۳۴ بامداد ۱۸ آوریل ارائه کردند، کاملاً آگاه بودند که دادگاه منطقه‌ای قصد دارد ۲۴ ساعت به دولت فرصت دهد تا پاسخی ارائه دهد. اما در آن درخواست، وکلا چیزی در مورد برنامه‌ای برای تجدیدنظرخواهی در صورت تصمیم دادگاه منطقه‌ای برای انتظار برای آن پاسخ نگفتند. 
تا ساعت ۱۲:۴۸ بعد از ظهر که درخواست اضطراری آنها برای یک کنفرانس فوری وضعیت بود، وکلا ناگهان به دادگاه اطلاع دادند که اگر دادگاه منطقه‌ای ظرف ۴۲ دقیقه، یعنی تا ساعت ۱:۳۰ بعد از ظهر، اقدام نکند، درخواست تجدیدنظر خواهند کرد. شماره ۱:۲۵–cv–۵۹ (ND Tex.، ۱۸ آوریل ۲۰۲۵)، ECF Doc. ۳۴، صفحه ۲. سپس وکلا درخواست تجدیدنظر خود را در ساعت ۳:۰۲ بعد از ظهر، تنها ۱۳۳ دقیقه پس از ابلاغ به دادگاه ناحیه مبنی بر درخواست تجدیدنظر، ثبت کردند. پاسخ ۱۰. صرف نظر از اینکه اقدامات انجام شده توسط وکلای متقاضیان تحت شرایط موجه تلقی می‌شود یا خیر، ارائه چنین اولتیماتومی به قاضی دادگاه ناحیه ("در مورد درخواست من در مورد یک موضوع پیچیده ظرف ۴۲ یا ۱۳۳ دقیقه اقدام کنید یا درخواست تجدیدنظر می‌دهم و شما را از صلاحیت قضایی محروم می‌کنم") نشان‌دهنده انحراف بسیار آشکار از آنچه معمولاً به عنوان رویه قابل قبول تلقی می‌شود، بود.


در مواجهه با درخواست فوق‌العاده متقاضیان، دادگاه ناحیه به شیوه‌ای کاملاً منطقی عمل کرد. دادگاه رفتار دادگاه ناحیه را در طول دوره مورد نظر "عدم اقدام" توصیف می‌کند، قبل از، در ساعت ۳، اما به نظر من، این ناعادلانه است. بلکه، همانطور که قاضی اشاره کرده است، او «با نهایت دقت برای حل [مسائل] مهم و پیچیده [ارائه شده توسط درخواست] در اسرع وقت تلاش می‌کرد.» ECF Doc. 41, p. 4. قاضی توضیح داد که هنوز حکم نداده است زیرا نمی‌تواند «از مسئولیت [خود] برای تصمیم‌گیری در مورد... مسائل پیچیده حقوقی بدون حداقل فرصتی برای بررسی دفاعیات و پیوست‌ها و دریافت پاسخ‌های متفکرانه از طرفین شانه خالی کند.» همان، صفحه ۵. و قاضی «آماده بود تا در اسرع وقت پس از ارائه پاسخ دولت اندکی پس از نیمه‌شب، اگر نه زودتر، دستوری صادر کند.» همان، صفحه ۴.
ما باید این رویکرد دقیق را تحسین کنیم، نه اینکه از آن انتقاد کنیم. تنها در چند ماه گذشته، ما احکام دادگاه منطقه‌ای را که بدون بررسی کافی مسائل مربوطه، دستور موقت صادر می‌کردند، لغو یا متوقف کرده‌ایم. به Trump v. J. G. G., 604 U. S. ___ (2025) (به ازای هر دوره) مراجعه کنید. وزارت آموزش و پرورش علیه کالیفرنیا، 604 U. S. ___ (2025) (به ازای هر کوریام). اما در این پرونده، قاضی دادگاه ناحیه‌ای با عدم اقدام در مدت زمان کمی بیش از دو ساعت در مورد درخواستی که نیاز به بررسی سوالات مهم و دشوار داشت و با ارائه مدارک واقعی پشتیبانی می‌شد، که همانطور که در زیر توضیح خواهم داد، بسیار ضعیف بودند، به عنوان رد سازنده حکم تلقی می‌شود. 
تحت این شرایط، من نمی‌توانم بپذیرم که عدم اقدام دادگاه ناحیه‌ای به منزله رد سازنده درخواست کمک متقاضیان بوده است.

ب
همانطور که اشاره کردم، پشتیبانی واقعی ارائه شده به دادگاه ناحیه‌ای ضعیف بود. دادگاه ادعا می‌کند که مدارک ارائه شده به دادگاه ناحیه‌ای در 18 آوریل نشان داد که یک وضعیت اضطراری وجود داشته که خطر بالای "عواقب جدی، شاید جبران‌ناپذیر" را به همراه داشته است. قبل از آن، در 3 (علامت نقل قول داخلی حذف شده است). اما مهم است که اطلاعات موجود در پرونده در 18 آوریل را با اطلاعات جدیدی که چند روز بعد به این دادگاه ارائه شد، اشتباه نگیریم.
پرونده‌ای که در تاریخ ۱۸ آوریل در دادگاه ناحیه‌ای ارائه شد (که همان پرونده‌ای است که در نیمه‌شب همان تاریخ در اختیار ما قرار گرفت) هیچ مدرک مشخصی مبنی بر قریب‌الوقوع بودن هرگونه جابجایی به گونه‌ای که نیاز به صدور فوری حکم باشد، ارائه نداد. مدارک واقعی ارائه شده توسط متقاضیان شامل شش اظهارنامه سوگند و عکسی بود که متقاضیان ادعا می‌کردند تصویر اخطار جابجایی است. به ضمیمه درخواست ۳۲-۳۷، ۵۶-۶۵ مراجعه کنید. اما نه اظهارات و نه عکس «فوریت شدید» را نشان نمی‌دادند. قبل از آن، در صفحه ۳.
اظهارات قطعاً نشان نمی‌داد که اقدامی برای محافظت از A. A. R. P. یا W. M. M. ضروری باشد. دولت در دادگاه ناحیه‌ای اظهار کرده بود که هیچ یک از این مردان - تنها طرفینی که بدون شک در دادگاه حضور داشتند - را در حالی که قرار احضاریه کوچک آنها صادر شده است، جابجا نخواهد کرد.پرونده‌ها در حال بررسی بودند. دستور شماره ۱:۲۵–cv–۵۹ (ND Tex.، ۱۷ آوریل ۲۰۲۵)، سند ECF، صفحه ۱. و دو اعلامیه مربوط به آن افراد هیچ ادعایی در مورد اخراج قریب‌الوقوع نداشتند. ضمیمه به درخواست ۳۲-۳۷. در واقع، اعلامیه‌های مربوط به آنها در ۱۵ آوریل، قبل از اظهار دولت مبنی بر اینکه آنها در حالی که درخواست‌های احضاریه آنها در حال بررسی است، اخراج نخواهند شد، امضا شده بودند. در نتیجه، اعلامیه‌ها قدیمی بودند و هیچ پشتیبانی از این ادعا که A. A. R. P. یا W. M. M. در ۱۸ یا ۱۹.۱ آوریل تهدید به اخراج شده‌اند، ارائه نکردند.
شواهد باقی‌مانده در پرونده در آن زمان فقط مربوط به اعضای ناشناس طبقه هنوز تأیید نشده بود. و از چهار اعلامیه مربوط به آن افراد، فقط یکی در مورد زمان احتمالی اخراج چیزی گفته بود. در آن اظهارنامه، وکیلی سوگند یاد کرد که تلفنی با یک مرد ونزوئلایی ناشناس صحبت کرده است که گفته است «ICE به آنها اطلاع داده است که امروز یا فردا به ونزوئلا اخراج خواهند شد.» همان، صفحه ۵۶. به عبارت دیگر، مشخص‌ترین مدرک موجود در پرونده، یک بیانیه دوگانه و مبتنی بر شایعات بود که نمی‌توان آن را به هیچ مقام دولتی خاصی نسبت داد. به غیر از این، هیچ یک از اظهارنامه‌های باقی‌مانده چیزی در مورد اخراج قریب‌الوقوع نگفتند. آنها صرفاً اظهار داشتند که برخی از بیگانگان اخطار اخراج دریافت می‌کنند، اما ادعا نشده بود که این اخطارها زمان احتمالی اخراج را مشخص کرده‌اند. به همان، صفحات ۵۷-۵۸ (اظهارنامه برانه)؛ همان، صفحات ۵۹-۶۰ (اظهارنامه کالینز)؛ همان، صفحه ۶۱ (اظهارنامه سیگل) مراجعه کنید. و تصویر سندی با عنوان «اطلاعیه و حکم بازداشت و اخراج تحت قانون دشمنان بیگانه» که متقاضیان آن را اخطار اخراج می‌نامیدند، نیز چیزی در مورد زمان اخراج نگفت. به همان، صفحات ۶۴-۶۵ مراجعه کنید. به غیر از این اظهارات، دادگاه با ادعاهای بی‌اساس وکیل در خود درخواست مواجه شد.

با نادیده گرفتن این نواقص در پرونده دادگاه ناحیه، دادگاه به اطلاعاتی استناد می‌کند که در پرونده دادگاه ناحیه وجود نداشت، یعنی (الف) اظهارات یک وکیل دولتی در جلسه رسیدگی به پرونده دیگری که عصر روز ۱۸ آوریل، مدت‌ها پس از درخواست تجدیدنظر متقاضیان، در واشنگتن دی سی برگزار شد و (ب) شواهدی که چند روز بعد دریافت کردیم. به بخش قبل، صفحه ۲ مراجعه کنید. اما در ارزیابی اینکه آیا دادگاه ناحیه به طور مؤثر از صدور قرار منع تعقیب خودداری کرده است یا خیر، باید حقایق را آنطور که در زمان مورد نظر برای آن دادگاه شناخته شده بود، در نظر بگیریم.

به همین دلایل، من با نظر هیئت متفق‌القول دادگاه تجدیدنظر موافقم که دادگاه ناحیه به طور سازنده درخواست صدور قرار منع تعقیب را رد نکرده است. همانطور که هیئت اظهار داشت، هیچ دلیلی برای تردید در مورد «کوشش و توانایی» دادگاه ناحیه برای اقدام مناسب تحت شرایط وجود نداشت. دستور شماره 25-10534 (CA5، 18 آوریل 2025)، ECF Doc. 14-1، صفحه 2. و «عدم صدور حکم درخواستی» او در مدت زمان فوق‌العاده کوتاهی که توسط متقاضیان مشخص شده است، نمی‌تواند به طور منطقی به عنوان «رد مؤثر دستور منع» تلقی شود. همان، صفحه 4 (رامیرز، جی.، موافق).

II
حتی اگر دادگاه منطقه‌ای درخواست متقاضیان را رد کرده بود، هیچ دلیلی برای لغو آن وجود نداشت زیرا متقاضیان الزامات دستور منع اضطراری را برآورده نکرده بودند، که یکی از آنها نشان دادن احتمال موفقیت در ماهیت است. Nken v. Holder، 556 U. S. 418, 434 (2009). و در اینجا، برای به دست آوردن آنچه درخواست به دنبال آن بود (و آنچه دادگاه اکنون ارائه می‌دهد) - یعنی، جبران خسارت برای اعضای گروهی که متقاضیان درخواست گواهی آن را داشتند - متقاضیان باید نشان می‌دادند که احتمالاً می‌توانند ثابت کنند که جبران خسارت گروهی در یک دادرسی مربوط به آزادی مشروط در دسترس است و اگر چنین جبرانی در دسترس باشد، احتمالاً الزامات استاندارد برای صدور گواهی طبقه‌بندی رعایت می‌شود.3

به نظر من، متقاضیان احتمالاً در هیچ یک از این موارد پیروز نخواهند شد.

الف
1

اولاً، جای تردید است که بتوان جبران خسارت گروهی را در یک دادرسی مربوط به آزادی مشروط به دست آورد. ما هرگز چنین نظری نداشته‌ایم و بسیار جای سوال است که آیا مجاز است یا خیر. اگرچه دادرسی‌های مربوط به آزادی مشروط به عنوان دادرسی مدنی طبقه‌بندی می‌شوند، قوانین فدرال آیین دادرسی مدنی فقط "تا حدی اعمال می‌شود که رویه در دادرسی‌های [حق آزادی مشروط] ... قبلاً با رویه در دعاوی مدنی مطابقت داشته باشد." قانون 81(a)(4)(B)؛ همچنین به قانون 1 مراجعه کنید. و مطابق با قانون 81، ما اذعان کرده‌ایم که برخی از قوانین فدرال در دادرسی‌های مربوط به آزادی مشروط قابل اجرا نیستند. برای مثال، در پرونده هریس علیه نلسون، 394 U. S. 286 (1969)، ما معتقد بودیم که قانون 33 - در مورد بازجویی‌ها - در دادرسی‌های مربوط به احضار به دادگاه اعمال نمی‌شود، زیرا هیچ مشابهی در رویه‌های تاریخی مربوط به احضار به دادگاه ندارد و در دادرسی‌های مربوط به احضار به دادگاه به خوبی جا نمی‌افتد. همان، صفحات 292-298. در میان موارد دیگر، ما خاطرنشان کردیم که رواج یافتن حقیقت در دادرسی‌های مربوط به احضار به دادگاه، یک تحول نسبتاً جدید است و دامنه خاص قانون 33 "با مشکلات و ویژگی‌های خاص دادرسی‌های [اعزام به دادگاه] نامناسب است." همان، صفحات 296.

دلایل مشابهی وجود دارد که باور کنیم قانون 23، که دعاوی دسته جمعی را مجاز می‌داند، در دادرسی‌های مربوط به احضار به دادگاه قابل اجرا نیست. نه دادگاه‌ها و نه مفسرانمن برای این رویه پشتوانه تاریخی پیدا کرده‌ام. یکی از مفسران، در سال ۱۹۶۸ نوشت، خاطرنشان کرد که «هیچ پرونده‌ای یافت نشده است که در آن چیزی شبیه به یک دعوی گروهی در habeas corpus استفاده شده باشد.» یادداشت، Multiparty Federal Habeas Corpus، 81 Harv. L. Rev. 1482, 1493 (1968). دو سال بعد، مفسر دیگری اظهار داشت که «دعاوی گروهی برای درخواست habeas corpus به ندرت مورد تلاش قرار گرفته است، شاید به این دلیل که قانون 81(a)(2) [که اکنون قانون 81(a)(4) است] به نظر می‌رسد که اعمال قانون دعوی گروهی مدنی را در رویه‌های habeas ممنوع می‌کند.» تحولات در قانون - Federal Habeas Corpus، 83 Harv. L. Rev. 1038, 1170 (1970) (پاورقی‌ها حذف شده‌اند). در واقع، به نظر می‌رسد بحث‌های تاریخی در مورد اینکه آیا حتی پیوستن به دادگاه در رویه habeas مجاز بوده است یا خیر، وجود دارد. مقایسه کنید با یادداشت، 81 Harv. L. Rev.، در ۱۴۹۴ («موضوع الحاق در هیچ یک از این پرونده‌ها به صراحت مورد بررسی قرار نگرفت و هیچ پرونده‌ای یافت نشد که صراحتاً این رویه را تأیید کند»)، با Developments in the Law—Federal Habeas Corpus، ۸۳ Harv. L. Rev.، در ۱۱۶۹ (با این استدلال که «قوانین مربوط به الحاق و ادغام حتی تحت محدودترین تفسیر قانون ۸۱ نیز اعمال می‌شوند»، اما به احکام مغایری که حداقل در یک پرونده یافت شده است (پاورقی‌ها حذف شده‌اند) استناد می‌کنند).

۲
علیرغم این فقدان پشتوانه تاریخی، برخی از دادگاه‌های پایین‌تر معتقدند که تصمیم ما در هریس گاهی اوقات رویه‌هایی را مجاز می‌داند که شبیه رویه‌های مورد استفاده در یک دعوی گروهی است. همانطور که اشاره شد، هریس معتقد بود که قانون ۳۳ که مربوط به بازجویی‌ها است، در مورد احضار به دادگاه (habeas) اعمال نمی‌شود، اما دادگاه همچنین اظهار داشت که دادگاه‌های احضار به دادگاه «می‌توانند شیوه‌های دادرسی مناسبی را، از طریق قیاس با قوانین موجود یا در غیر این صورت مطابق با عرف قضایی، ایجاد کنند»، زمانی که چنین شیوه‌های دادرسی برای «صلاحیت habeas corpus و وظیفه اعمال آن ضروری باشد». ۳۹۴ ایالات متحده، صفحه ۲۹۹. بر این اساس، هریس معتقد بود که یک دادگاه احضار به دادگاه می‌تواند از اختیارات خود تحت قانون همه احکام، ۲۸ ایالات متحده، بند ۱۶۵۱، برای ایجاد رویه ای شبیه به بازجویی استفاده کند، تا جایی که چنین ابزاری توسط دادگاه «مورد نیاز» باشد تا «وظیفه [خود] را» برای «رسیدگی مختصر و تعیین حقایق و حل و فصل موضوع طبق قانون و عدالت» انجام دهد. ۳۹۴ ایالات متحده، صفحه ۲۹۹-۳۰۰ (علامت‌های نقل قول داخلی حذف شده‌اند).
بر اساس این بحث در پرونده هریس، دادگاه حوزه دوم رأی داد که اگرچه خودِ قانون فدرال آیین دادرسی مدنی ۲۳ در مورد احضار به دادگاه تجدیدنظر اعمال نمی‌شود، اما «یک دادرسی چندجانبه مشابه» یک دعوی دسته‌جمعیِ قانون ۲۳ گاهی مجاز است. United States ex rel. Sero v. Preiser, 506 F. 2d 1115, 1125 (CA2 1974). و نتیجه گرفت که این رویه در «شرایط غیرمعمول» موجود در پرونده مورد بحث مناسب است. همانجا؛ همچنین به Bijeol v. Benson, 513 F. 2d 965, 968 (CA7 1975) مراجعه کنید.

این قرائت از هریس بسیار جای سوال دارد. در مواردی که یک قانون خاص در مورد احضار به دادگاه تجدیدنظر اعمال نمی‌شود، دادگاه نمی‌تواند با گفتن اینکه همان ویژگی را تحت یک عنوان متفاوت وارد می‌کند، از این محدودیت عبور کند. هریس نتیجه گرفت که چیزی شبیه به یک جلسه بازجویی مجاز است زیرا تحت شرایط لازم بود تا به دادگاه احضار به حبس کمک کند تا وظیفه‌ای را که به وضوح توسط قانون تعیین شده است، یعنی «تعیین حقایق» که برای ادعای مطرح شده توسط شاکی که در دادگاه حضور داشته، مهم هستند، انجام دهد. 394 U. S.، در صفحه 299 (به نقل از 28 U. S. C. §2243). 
وضعیت در اینجا متفاوت است. هیچ ماده قانونی وظیفه تعیین حقایق یا تصمیم‌گیری در مورد مسائل حقوقی مربوط به طرفینی که در دادگاه حضور ندارند را به دادگاه احضار به حبس تحمیل نمی‌کند. و به طور کلی، ابزار دعوی گروهی به طور منحصر به فرد برای رسیدگی به احضار به حبس، همان، در صفحه 296، که اغلب به تصمیمات فردی و خاص در مورد حبس یک زندانی خاص مربوط می‌شود، «نامناسب» است.

ب
حتی اگر چیزی شبیه به یک دعوی گروهی بتواند در یک رسیدگی به احضار به حبس استفاده شود، بسیار جای سوال است که آیا الزامات صدور گواهینامه گروهی در این مورد قابل رعایت است یا خیر. قانون 23(a)(3) مقرر می‌دارد که شاکیانِ نامبرده می‌توانند «فقط در صورتی» به عنوان نمایندگان یک دسته شکایت کنند که، از جمله موارد دیگر، «ادعاها یا دفاعیاتِ طرفینِ نماینده، نمونه‌ای از ادعاها یا دفاعیاتِ دسته باشد». و هنگامی که دادگاهی یک دسته را تأیید می‌کند، قرار است «ادعاهای» دقیقی را که به صورت کلی در کل دسته مورد رسیدگی قرار می‌گیرند، تعریف کند. به قانون 23(c)(1)(B) مراجعه کنید. این امر تضمین می‌کند که تنها ادعاهایی که در یک دعوی دسته مورد رسیدگی قرار می‌گیرند، ادعاهایی هستند که دسته به طور مشترک مطرح می‌کنند و ادعاهایی که شاکیان نامبرده نمایندگان «معمولی» دسته هستند. به پرونده شرکت تلفن عمومی شمال غربی علیه EEOC، 446 U. S. 318, 330 (1980) مراجعه کنید («گفته می‌شود الزامِ نمونه بودن، ادعاهای دسته را به ادعاهایی محدود می‌کند که به طور منصفانه در ادعاهای شاکی نامبرده گنجانده شده‌اند»).
با این حال، در اینجا، درخواست اصلی موقت که از طرف گروه فرضی درخواست شده است - اطلاع رسانی کافی در مورد برنامه‌های اخراج تحت AEA و فرصتی برای اعتراض به چنین اخراجی در دادگاه، به درخواست‌های ۱۷-۱۸؛ پاسخ ۵-۷ مراجعه کنید - توسط A. A. R. P. یا W. M. M. که در حال حاضر یک پرونده احضار به دادگاه در حال بررسی دارند و قول داده‌اند که تا پایان آن پرونده اخراج نخواهند شد، لازم نیست. به همین دلیل، وضعیت آنها متفاوت است.این موضوع با بسیاری از اعضای فرضی گروه، تفاوت اساسی دارد، زیرا آنها هیچ سهم شخصی در نحوه حل مسئله درخواست کمک موقت توسط دادگاه برای اعضای فرضی گروه ندارند.


دادگاه با این پیشنهاد به این مشکل پاسخ می‌دهد که یک متهم در یک دعوی گروهی نمی‌تواند "با وعده دادن به شاکیان نامبرده به عنوان یک امر لطف‌آمیز، در صورت مناسب بودن، رفتار گروهی را نقض کند." قبل از آن، در صفحه 7 (تأکید اضافه شده است). اما دادگاه هیچ تحلیلی ارائه نمی‌دهد که نشان دهد صدور گواهی گروهی در اینجا "در غیر این صورت مناسب است" و در عوض ادعا می‌کند که می‌تواند مسئله صدور گواهی گروهی را در این مرحله مقدماتی نادیده بگیرد. همانجا. و در هر صورت، پرونده نشان نمی‌دهد که دولت با شاکیان نامبرده "به عنوان یک امر لطف‌آمیز" رفتار متفاوتی دارد. همانجا. بلکه، این کار را طبق سیاست کلی خود در برابر اخراج بازداشت‌شدگان AEA در زمانی که درخواست آزادی مشروط دارند، انجام می‌دهد. به مخالفت با درخواست اضطراری 2 مراجعه کنید ("دولت موافقت کرده است که طبق [مطابق] AEA، بازداشت‌شدگان AEA را که درخواست آزادی مشروط ارائه می‌دهند، اخراج نکند").


ج
ما به دادگاه‌های ناحیه گفته‌ایم که تنها پس از انجام «تحلیل دقیق» از سوال، می‌توانند یک دعوی کلاسه را تأیید کنند. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v. Dukes, 564 U. S. 338, 351 (2011) (به نقل از General Telephone Co. of Southwest v. Falcon, 457 U. S. 147, 161 (1982)). در 18 آوریل، دادگاه ناحیه زمانی برای انجام چنین تحلیلی نداشت و در نتیجه، نمی‌توان گفت که دادگاه از اختیار خود در عدم نتیجه‌گیری مبنی بر اینکه متقاضیان احتمالاً در استدلال‌های گروهی خود پیروز می‌شوند، سوءاستفاده کرده است. رجوع کنید به University of Tex. v. Camenisch, 451 U. S. 390, 393–394 (1981). 
دادگاه ناحیه از آن زمان فرصت داشته است تا «تحلیل دقیقی» را که رویه‌های قضایی ما ایجاب می‌کند، انجام دهد و به این نتیجه رسیده است که صدور گواهی کلاسه در اینجا نامناسب خواهد بود. دستور شماره ۱:۲۵–cv–۵۹ (ND Tex.، ۹ مه ۲۰۲۵)، سند ECF ۶۷. این تحول، قرار صادر شده توسط دادگاه امروز را بیش از پیش غیرعادی می‌کند. دادگاه با ادعای اعمال صلاحیت تجدیدنظر خود، «قرار مقدماتی» را برای یک گروه فرضی صادر می‌کند که دادگاه ناحیه صراحتاً از تأیید آن خودداری کرده است، و این کار را بدون ارائه هیچ تحلیل ماهوی که نشان دهد تحلیل دادگاه ناحیه از موضوع تأیید گروه نادرست بوده است، انجام می‌دهد.


به جای پرداختن ماهوی به دستور دادگاه ناحیه، دادگاه ادعا می‌کند که این دستور هیچ تفاوتی ایجاد نمی‌کند زیرا «در درجه اول به توانایی بازداشت‌شدگان برای به چالش کشیدن اعتبار حذف AEA به صورت سراسری در کل گروه پرداخته است»، در حالی که «درخواست ارائه شده به این دادگاه فقط به دنبال اثبات حقوق مربوط به اخطار است.» Ante، در ۶، شماره *. اما دستور دادگاه ناحیه به مسئله اخطار پرداخته است. علاوه بر توضیح اینکه چرا متقاضیان نمی‌توانند ادعاهای مربوط به شایستگی نهایی خود را به عنوان یک دعوی گروهی پیگیری کنند، این دستور به تفصیل توضیح می‌دهد که چرا ادعاهای متقاضیان در مورد حقوق مربوط به اخطاریه نیز نمی‌تواند به صورت گروهی مطرح شود. سند ECF 67، صفحات 29-31، 33، 38-39. در میان موارد دیگر، دادگاه ناحیه اظهار داشت که "روند دادرسی به خودی خود فردی است"، همان، صفحه 33، پیشنهادی که به وضوح توسط رویه‌های قضایی ما پشتیبانی می‌شود. به Jennings v. Rodriguez، 583 U. S. 281، 314 (2018) مراجعه کنید ("روند دادرسی انعطاف‌پذیر است، ما بارها تأکید کرده‌ایم، و مستلزم حمایت‌های رویه‌ای است که شرایط خاص ایجاب می‌کند" (علامت‌های نقل قول داخلی و تغییرات حذف شده‌اند)). 
در هر صورت، دادگاه ناحیه همچنین چندین دلیل کلی ارائه داد که چرا تخفیف گروهی در اینجا نامناسب است، و این دلایل به طور یکسان در مورد ادعاهای متقاضیان در مورد حقوق مربوط به اخطاریه نیز صدق می‌کند. به سند ECF 67، صفحات 35-36، 39-45 مراجعه کنید. دادگاه امروز بدون پرداختن به هیچ یک از آن تحلیل‌ها، قرار موقت صادر می‌کند. و علاوه بر این، از حوزه پنجم قضایی می‌خواهد که در نهایت در مورد حقوق اطلاع‌رسانی اعضای گروه فرضی بدون درخواست از آن دادگاه برای انجام تحلیل خود در مورد اینکه آیا صدور گواهی گروهی در مورد آن ادعاها مناسب است یا خیر، تصمیم‌گیری کند. قبل از آن، ساعت ۸. واضح است که دادگاه ترجیح می‌دهد مرحله مهم صدور گواهی گروهی را نادیده بگیرد و مستقیماً به بررسی حقوق اعضای گروه بپردازد. قوانین فدرال چنین راه میانبری را مجاز نمی‌دانند.

III
به جای اینکه صرفاً در مورد درخواستی که پیش روی ماست - که درخواست صدور حکم اضطراری در انتظار تجدیدنظر را دارد - تصمیم بگیرد، دادگاه گام غیرمعمولی را برای صدور گواهی قبل از صدور حکم برمی‌دارد، حکم زیر را به طور خلاصه رد می‌کند و تجدیدنظرخواهی متقاضیان را رد می‌کند و پرونده را به دادگاه تجدیدنظر با دستورالعمل‌هایی در مورد مسائلی که دادگاه باید به آنها رسیدگی کند، ارجاع می‌دهد. از دستور دادگاه، کاملاً مشخص نیست که آیا دادگاه در مورد مسائلی که فراتر از مسئله حکم موقت هستند، به طور خاموش تصمیم‌گیری کرده است یا خیر. (قطعاً امیدوارم که این کار را نکرده باشد.) اما اگر این کار را کرده باشد، دستور امروز دو برابر خارق‌العاده است. اعطای گواهی عدم سوءپیشینه قبل از صدور حکم توسط دادگاه تجدیدنظر، انحراف شدیدی از رویه معمول است، اما در اینجا نه دادگاه تجدیدنظر و نه دادگاه بدوی هیچ گونه سوال مربوط به ماهیت پرونده را بررسی نکرده‌اند. 
ما بارها و بارها گفته‌ایم که «مادادگاه تجدیدنظر، نه نظر اولیه.» کاتر علیه ویلکینسون، 544 U. S. 709, 718, n. 7 (2005). حتی با توجه به برداشت دادگاه از آنچه در ادامه آمده است، تمام آنچه دادگاه ناحیه و دادگاه تجدیدنظر تصمیم گرفتند این بود که متقاضیان حق دریافت حکم منع موقت را ندارند. اگر دادگاه فراتر از این سوال رفته باشد، مسیر جدیدی را گشوده است. این دادگاه یک پرونده را از دادگاه ناحیه‌ای بیرون کشیده و در وهله اول در مورد مسائل مهم تصمیم گرفته است. از نظر من، این بسیار شبیه گسترش صلاحیت اصلی ما است.
بنابراین باید با احترام مخالفت کنم.

1 دولت «به صراحت» به دادگاه ناحیه گفت که «در حال حاضر انتظار ندارد A.A.R.P. یا W.M.M. را حذف کند.» طبق [قانون دشمنان بیگانه (AEA)] تا پس از حل و فصل دادخواست در حال بررسی، [این قانون] «و اینکه در صورت تغییر، دادگاه ناحیه را «به‌روزرسانی» خواهد کرد». سند ۲۷، صفحه ۱ از ECF. و در درخواست خود برای دریافت کمک به این دادگاه، متقاضیان ادعا نکردند که به طور خاص A. A. R. P. یا W. M. M. در معرض خطر اخراج قرار دارند. برعکس، متقاضیان اظهار داشتند که با دولت تماس گرفته‌اند و به آنها گفته شده است که «به دو متقاضی نامبرده اخطار [اخراج] داده نشده است.» درخواست ۵، شماره ۳. دولت بعداً در پرونده‌های خود به این دادگاه تأیید کرد که «موافقت کرده است که طبق [مقررات] AEA، آن دسته از بازداشت‌شدگان AEA را که درخواست‌های احضار به دادگاه را مطرح می‌کنند، از جمله متقاضیان نامبرده، از زندان خارج نکند.» مخالفت با درخواست اضطراری ۲.

۲ علاوه بر این، به نظر من دادگاه در مورد آنچه وکیل دولت در جلسه استماع ۱۸ آوریل گفته است، اغراق می‌کند. وکیل اظهار داشت که «قطعاً» «امشب هیچ پروازی وجود ندارد» و «افرادی که [او] با آنها صحبت کرده از هیچ برنامه‌ای برای پروازهای فردا مطلع نبوده‌اند.» رویه دادرسی در پرونده جی. جی. جی. علیه ترامپ، سند ECF 93، صفحه 15. اگرچه وکیل همچنین گفت که وزارت امنیت داخلی "حق انتقال افراد را برای فردا محفوظ می‌دارد"، اما بارها تکرار کرد که هیچ پروازی برای 19 آوریل برنامه‌ریزی نشده است. همان، صفحه 26؛ همچنین به همان، صفحات 9، 15، 29-30 مراجعه کنید. اظهارات وکیل نشان داد که احتمال آسیب در آینده وجود دارد، اما نه اینکه چنین آسیبی قطعاً قریب‌الوقوع باشد. Clapper v. Amnesty Int’l, USA, 568 U. S. 398, 410 (2013).

3 دادگاه ادعا می‌کند که "دادگاه‌ها می‌توانند بدون "تصمیم‌گیری در مورد اینکه آیا یک طبقه باید تأیید شود یا خیر"، به طور موقت به یک طبقه فرضی تخفیف دهند." Ante، در صفحه ۷. دادگاه در حمایت از این پیشنهاد، به هیچ سابقه‌ای از این دادگاه استناد نمی‌کند. در عوض، به رساله‌ای استناد می‌کند که هیچ استدلال ماهوی در حمایت از این پیشنهاد ارائه نمی‌دهد. به همانجا مراجعه کنید (با استناد به ۲ W. Rubenstein, Newberg & Rubenstein on Class Actions §۴:۳۰ (ویرایش ششم ۲۰۲۲ و ضمیمه ۲۰۲۴). حتی اگر دادگاه درست می‌گفت، موضع آن تصمیم خود را برای نادیده گرفتن کامل موضوع صدور گواهی توجیه نمی‌کرد. دادگاهی که در حال بررسی صدور قرار منع مقدماتی است، باید در نظر بگیرد که آیا موکل احتمالاً در ماهیت موفق خواهد شد یا خیر. و برای بررسی اینکه آیا درخواست برای قرار منع سراسری احتمالاً در ماهیت موفق خواهد شد یا خیر، دادگاه حداقل باید در نظر بگیرد که آیا صدور گواهی جمعی محتمل است یا خیر.
