________________________________________
When hospitals provide inpatient services to Medicare beneficiaries, the Medicare program pays those hospitals a fixed rate for treating each Medicare patient. See 42 U. S. C. §§1395ww(d)(1)–(4). Congress also provides various hospital-specific rate adjustments, including the “disproportionate share hospital” (DSH) adjustment, which offers additional funding to hospitals that treat a high percentage of low-income patients. To calculate the DSH adjustment, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) adds together two statutorily prescribed fractions referred to as the Medicare fraction and the Medicaid fraction. §1395ww(d)(5)(F)(vi). The Medicare fraction “represents the proportion of a hospital’s Medicare patients who have low incomes,” and the Medicaid fraction “represents the proportion of a hospital’s patients who are not entitled to Medicare and have low incomes.” Becerra v. Empire Health Foundation, for Valley Hospital Medical Center, 597 U. S. 424, 429–430. When the Medicare fraction is expressed as a percentage and added to the Medicaid fraction’s percentage, the sum yields the disproportionate patient percentage. §1395ww(d)(5)(F)(vi). That percentage, in turn, determines whether a hospital will receive a DSH adjustment—and if so, how much.
 Relevant here, the numerator of the Medicare is defined by the statute as “the number of [a] hospital’s patient days” attributable to patients “who (for such days) were entitled to benefits under [Medicare] part A” and “entitled to supplementary security income [SSI] benefits  . . . under subchapter XVI.” §1395ww(d)(5)(F)(vi)(I). This Court in Empire Health has held that the phrase “ ‘entitled to [Medicare Part A] benefits’ ” in the Medicare fraction includes “all those qualifying for the program, regardless of whether they are receiving Medicare payments for part or all of a hospital stay.” 597 U. S., at 445 (quoting §1395ww(d)(5)(F)(vi)(I); alteration in original). But the Court has not addressed the issue presented in this case—i.e., which patients count as being “entitled to [SSI] benefits . . . under subchapter XVI.” HHS interprets the language to mean patients who are entitled to receive an SSI payment during the month in which they were hospitalized. Petitioners—a group of more than 200 hospitals—insist that the phrase includes all patients enrolled in the SSI system at the time of their hospitalization, even if they were not entitled to an SSI payment during their month of hospitalization. The hospitals claim that, as a result of HHS’s misinterpretation of the phrase, HHS miscalculated the hospitals’ DSH adjustment and underfunded the hospitals from 2006 to 2009. The hospitals have lost at every stage of this litigation, including most recently before the D. C. Circuit. The D. C. Circuit concluded that SSI benefits in “subchapter XVI [are] about cash payments for needy individuals,” and that “it makes little sense to say that individuals are ‘entitled’ to the benefit in months when they are not even eligible for [a payment].” Advocate Christ Medical Center v. Becerra, 80 F. 4th 346, 352–353. The Court granted certiorari.
Held: In calculating the Medicare fraction, an individual is “entitled to [SSI] benefits” for purposes of the Medicare fraction when she is eligible to receive an SSI cash payment during the month of her hospitalization. Pp. 6–16.
 (a)  SSI benefits are cash benefits. See 42 U. S. C. ch. 7, subch. XVI. Section 1381a, which describes the basic entitlement to benefits, provides that “[e]very . . . individual who is determined . . . to be eligible on the basis of his income and resources shall . . . be paid benefits.” (Emphasis added.) The word “paid” connotes cash. Section 1382(b)(1), which specifies the amount that the Social Security Administration must pay to eligible individuals, states that the benefits “shall be payable at the rate of [specific dollar amounts].” A benefit quantified in dollar amounts is plainly a cash benefit. Similarly, subchapter XVI’s codified statement of purpose is “to provide supplemental security income to individuals.” §1381 (emphasis added).
 Just as subchapter XVI makes clear that SSI benefits are cash benefits, it also establishes that eligibility for such benefits is determined on a monthly basis. Section 1382(c)(1) provides that “[a]n individual’s eligibility for a benefit under this subchapter for a month shall be determined” based on the individual’s “income, resources, and other rel evant characteristics in such month.” The statute’s reference to termination of benefits also refers back to months of ineligibility, stating that an individual must reapply for the program after she has been “ineligible for benefits . . . for a period of 12 consecutive months.” §1383(j)(1)(B).
 Finally, although subchapter XVI speaks primarily in terms of eligibility for SSI benefits, the Medicare fraction focuses on whether an individual is entitled to such benefits. Nothing turns on this difference. In Empire Health, the Court treated the word “entitled” in the Medicare statute as synonymous with “qualifying” for or “being eligible . . . for benefits.” 597 U. S., at 435. This case also involves the Medicare fraction, so the Court follows the same course. Because eligibility for an SSI payment is determined on a monthly basis, an individual is considered “entitled to [SSI] benefits” for purposes of the Medicare fraction when she is eligible for such benefits during the month of her hospitalization. Pp. 6–9.
 (b) The hospitals’ broader reading of “entitled to [SSI] benefits” fails. Pp. 9–16.
  (1) While the hospitals characterize SSI benefits as including noncash benefits—e.g., vocational rehabilitation services and continued Medicaid coverage—these noncash benefits do not fit the description of a “supplementa[l] security income” benefit. §1395ww(d)(5)(F)(vi)(I) (emphasis added). Further, none of the noncash benefits identified by the hospitals is housed “under subchapter XVI.” Ibid. (emphasis added). The hospitals’ reliance on the Ticket to Work and Self-Sufficiency Program falls short for this reason. Nor do any of subchapter XVI’s other references to vocational rehabilitation services confer an SSI benefit. Rather, §1382d’s references to certain services point to benefits housed elsewhere, but not within subchapter XVI.
 The hospitals’ reliance on continued Medicaid coverage pursuant to §1382h(b) also falls flat. In most States, eligibility for SSI benefits qualifies an individual for Medicaid coverage. While losing SSI benefits generally means losing Medicaid coverage, §1382h(b) allows certain people ineligible for SSI benefits in a given month to be treated as if they remain eligible for SSI benefits so that they can continue receiving Medicaid. But §1382h(b), which by its terms applies only to Medicaid (i.e., “subchapter XIX”), simply aids in the administration of the Medicaid program. It does not create an SSI benefit. Pp. 9–11.
  (2) The hospitals advance a second argument that eligibility for SSI benefits—even for purely cash benefits—begins when a person enters the SSI system and continues until the individual is ineligible for an SSI payment for 12 consecutive months. While it is true that a person first applying for benefits must disclose her income “rate” “for the calendar year,” §1382(a)(1)(A), that “calendar year” income does  not render her eligible for SSI benefits, nor does it establish that SSI benefits operate in intervals with a duration longer than one month. Instead, the statute clearly directs eligibility decisions to be made monthly based on “the individual’s . . . income, resources, and other relevant characteristics in such month.” §1382(c) (emphasis added). Nor does the reapplication requirement change the nature of eligibility. Under §1383(j)(1)(B), a once-eligible individual must submit a new application after she has been “ineligible for benefits . . . for a period of 12 consecutive months.” That provision does not state that a person remains eligible during this period; it states that a person who “was an eligible individual” at one point must reapply after 12 consecutive months of ineligibility. §1383(j)(1)(A) (emphasis added).
 The hospitals also assert that Empire Health supports their theory that being “entitled to [SSI] benefits” means that a patient is entitled to SSI benefits even if she does not qualify for a payment during the month of hospitalization. Not so. Just as Empire Health turned on the specific features of Medicare Part A, this case turns on the specific features of SSI benefits under subchapter XVI. Unlike Medicare Part A, which provides automatic, ongoing health insurance that “never goes away” absent diminished disability, Empire Health, 597 U. S., at 437, SSI benefits require recipients to apply for and be deemed eligible for benefits, and recipients can (and do) fluctuate in and out of eligibility based on monthly income and resources. Consistency with Empire Health’s benefit-focused analysis thus requires the Court to recognize and give effect to the differences between Medicare Part A and SSI benefits. Pp. 11–14.
  (3) Finally, invoking statutory purpose, the hospitals argue that their broad reading of “entitled to [SSI] benefits” better advances Congress’s goal of providing additional funds to hospitals that serve a disproportionately high percentage of needy Medicare patients. But “[n]o statute pursues a single policy at all costs,” Bartenwerfer v. Buckley, 598 U. S. 69, 81, and the Court must respect the specific formula that Congress prescribed. Pp. 14–16.
80 F. 4th 346, affirmed.

ADVOCATE CHRIST MEDICAL CENTER, ET AL., PETITIONERS v. ROBERT F. KENNEDY, JR., SECRETARY OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES
on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit

________________________________________
 JUSTICE BARRETT delivered the opinion of the Court.
 The Medicare program, which provides health insurance to elderly or disabled Americans, is governed by a notoriously complex statute. Unsurprisingly, then, the provision at issue in this case is highly technical: It prescribes a percentage used to calculate the rate that the Government will pay a hospital that treats a disproportionate share of low-income Medicare patients. The percentage is determined by the sum of two fractions—the so-called Medicare fraction and Medicaid fraction. Relevant here, the numerator of the Medicare fraction counts the number of patient days attributable to Medicare patients who were “entitled to benefits under [Medicare] part A” and were “entitled to supplementary security income benefits . . . under subchapter XVI.” 42 U. S. C. §1395ww(d)(5)(F)(vi)(I).
 In Becerra v. Empire Health Foundation, for Valley Hospital Medical Center, we held that the phrase “ ‘entitled to [Medicare Part A] benefits’ ” includes “all those qualifying for the program, regardless of whether they are receiving Medicare payments for part or all of a hospital stay.” 597  U. S. 424, 445 (2022) (quoting §1395ww(d)(5)(F)(vi)(I); alteration in original). We did not decide, however, what it means to be “entitled to supplementary security income benefits . . . under subchapter XVI.” §1395ww(d)(5)(F) (vi)(I). Today, we hold that a person is entitled to such benefits when she is eligible to receive a cash payment during the month of her hospitalization.
I
 The Medicare program reimburses hospitals that provide inpatient services to Medicare beneficiaries. See §1395ww(d). As a rule, the “program pays a hospital a fixed rate for treating each Medicare patient, based on the patient’s diagnosis,” which is “designed to reflect the amounts an efficiently run hospital, in the same region, would expend to treat a patient with the same diagnosis.” Id., at 429 (citing §§1395ww(d)(1)–(4) and 42 CFR §412.2 (2022)). Because the fixed-rate payment is provided “regardless of the hospital’s actual costs,” it “gives hospitals an incentive to provide efficient levels of medical service.” Empire Health, 597 U. S., at 429.
 Congress also “provided for various hospital-specific rate adjustments—including the one at issue here for treating low-income patients.” Ibid. That adjustment is called the “disproportionate share hospital” (DSH) adjustment, which provides “hospitals serving an ‘unusually high percentage of low-income patients’ enhanced Medicare payments.” Ibid. (quoting Sebelius v. Auburn Regional Medical Center, 568 U. S. 145, 150 (2013)). This adjustment accounts for the fact that “low-income individuals are often more expensive to treat than higher income ones, even for the same medical conditions.” Empire Health, 597 U. S., at 429. The enhanced payment incentivizes hospitals to treat low- income patients. See ibid.
 In Empire Health, we described the DSH adjustment in  great detail, so here, we will be brief. To calculate a hospital’s DSH adjustment, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) adds together “two statutorily described fractions, usually called the Medicare fraction and the Medicaid fraction.” Ibid.; see §1395ww(d)(5)(F)(vi). Together, these fractions are “designed to capture two different low-income populations that a hospital serves.” Id., at 429. The “Medicare fraction represents the proportion of a hospital’s Medicare patients who have low incomes, as identified by their entitlement to supplementary security income (SSI) benefits.” Id., at 429–430. And “[t]he Medicaid fraction represents the proportion of a hospital’s patients who are not entitled to Medicare and have low incomes, as identified by their eligibility for Medicaid.” Id., at 430.
 Like Empire Health, this case concerns the Medicare fraction, which is defined as:
“the fraction (expressed as a percentage), the numerator of which is the number of such hospital’s patient days for such period which were made up of patients who (for such days) were entitled to benefits under part A of this subchapter and were entitled to supplementary security income benefits (excluding any State supplementation) under subchapter XVI of this chapter, and the denominator of which is the number of such hospital’s patient days for such fiscal year which were made up of patients who (for such days) were entitled to benefits under part A of this subchapter.” §1395ww(d) (5)(F)(vi)(I).1
 In plainer English, the Medicare fraction works like this:  The numerator counts “the number of patient days attributable to Medicare patients who are poor”—i.e., those Medicare patients who are entitled to SSI benefits under subchapter XVI. Id., at 430. The denominator counts “the number of patient days attributable to all Medicare patients.” Ibid. When the Medicare fraction is expressed as a percentage and added to the Medicaid fraction’s percentage, the sum of the two yields the “ ‘disproportionate patient percentage.’ ” §1395ww(d)(5)(F)(vi). The resulting percentage “determines whether a hospital will receive a DSH adjustment”—and if so, how much. Id., at 431. “The higher the disproportionate-patient percentage,” the more funding a hospital receives. Id., at 432 (citing §§1395ww(d)(5) (F)(vii)–(xiv)).
 For purposes of this case, the key phrase in the Medicare fraction is “entitled to supplementary security income benefits . . . under subchapter XVI.” §1395ww(d)(5)(F)(vi)(I). Supplemental security income is “a subsistence allowance” offered to the country’s “needy aged, blind, and disabled.” Schweiker v. Wilson, 450 U. S. 221, 223 (1981); see also §1381 (describing subchapter XVI as a “national program to provide supplemental security income to individuals who have attained age 65 or are blind or disabled”). HHS interprets the relevant text to refer to patients who are “entitled to receive SSI benefits during the month” in which they were hospitalized. 75 Fed. Reg. 50281 (2010).2
 Petitioners, a group of more than 200 hospitals, disagree with this interpretation. They insist that the phrase encompasses all patients enrolled in the SSI system at the time of their hospitalizations, even if those patients were not entitled to an SSI payment during that month. This approach sweeps more people into the numerator of the Medicare fraction, thereby increasing the amount of funding a hospital may receive. See §§1395ww(d)(5)(F)(vii)–(xiv). The hospitals claim that because HHS misconstrued the Medicare fraction, it underfunded them during the fiscal years 2006 to 2009.
 The hospitals have lost at every step of this litigation. The Provider Reimbursement Review Board, a tribunal within HHS, denied the hospitals’ request for additional reimbursement on procedural grounds. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, which administers Medicare for HHS, also denied relief, this time on the merits. The hospitals then sought review in the District Court, which rejected their claims and granted summary judgment to HHS.  See Advocate Christ Medical Center v. Azar, No. 17–cv–1519 (D DC, June 8, 2022), App. to Pet. for Cert. 18. The D. C. Circuit also agreed with HHS. See Advocate Christ Medical Center v. Becerra, 80 F. 4th 346 (2023). In explaining that SSI benefits in “subchapter XVI [are] about cash payments for needy individuals,” the D. C. Circuit observed that “it makes little sense to say that individuals are ‘entitled’ to the benefit in months when they are not even eligible for [a payment].” Id., at 352–353. We granted certiorari. 601 U. S. ___ (2024).
II
 To determine when a person is “entitled to supplementary security income benefits,” §1395ww(d)(5)(F)(vi)(I), we must know what the benefits are. See Empire Health, 597 U. S., at 435–439. The answer is clear: SSI benefits are cash benefits. See 42 U. S. C. ch. 7, subch. XVI. Section 1381a, which describes the basic entitlement to benefits, provides that “[e]very . . . individual who is determined . . . to be eligible on the basis of his income and resources shall . . . be paid benefits by the Commissioner.” (Emphasis added.) The word “paid” obviously connotes a cash benefit. Section 1382(b) sings the same tune: It specifies the amount that SSA is required to pay eligible individuals, stating that “[t]he benefit under this subchapter . . . shall be payable at the rate of [specific dollar amounts].” §1382(b)(1). A benefit quantified in dollar amounts is plainly a cash benefit. Echoing the point, other provisions explain how and when the cash benefit is to be paid to recipients. See, e.g., §1383 (prescribing procedures for the “payment of benefits” (boldface deleted)); §1383(a)(4)(A) (permitting a “cash advance against such benefits” to individuals in limited circumstances).3 Subchapter XVI’s codified statement of purpose  is of a piece: to “establis[h] a national program to provide supplemental security income to individuals who have attained age 65 or are blind or disabled.” §1381 (emphasis added). “Income” is “a gain or recurrent benefit that is usu[ally] measured in money and for a given period of time.” 2 Webster’s Third New International Dictionary 1143 (1971).
 Statutory provisions outside subchapter XVI also understand the phrase “[SSI] benefits . . . under subchapter XVI” to mean a cash benefit. Take §1320b–19 in subchapter XI, which directs the Commissioner of Social Security to establish the Ticket to Work and Self-Sufficiency Program. Section 1320b–19 defines the phrase “supplemental security income benefit” to mean “a cash benefit under section 1382 or 1382h(a) of this title.” §1320b–19(k)(5); see also §1320a–6(b) (defining the term “supplemental security income benefits” to “mea[n] benefits paid or payable by the Commissioner of Social Security under subchapter XVI”). Same too in subchapter VIII, which provides special benefits for certain World War II veterans. There, Congress defined the “ ‘[f]ederal benefit rate under subchapter XVI’ ” to mean “with respect to any month, the amount of the supplemental security income cash benefit.” §1012(4).
 Just as subchapter XVI makes clear that SSI benefits are cash benefits, it also establishes that eligibility for such benefits is determined on a monthly basis. Section 1382(c)(1) provides that “[a]n individual’s eligibility for a benefit under this subchapter for a month shall be determined” based on the individual’s “income, resources, and other relevant characteristics in such month.” The statute’s reference to termination of benefits also refers back to months of ineligibility: An individual must reapply for the  program after she has been “ineligible for benefits . . . for a period of 12 consecutive months.” §1383(j)(1)(B). Other examples similarly confirm that eligibility is a month-to-month inquiry. See, e.g., §1382(e)(1)(A) (providing that “no person shall be an eligible individual . . . with respect to any month if throughout such month he is an inmate of a public institution”); §1382(e)(1)(D) (providing that “[a] person may be an eligible individual . . . with respect to any month throughout which he is a resident of a public emergency shelter for the homeless”); §§1382(e)(4)(A)(i)–(ii) (providing that “[n]o person shall be considered an eligible individual . . . with respect to any month if during such month the person is . . . fleeing to avoid prosecution” or violating “a condition of probation or parole”).
 A note for the sake of completeness: While subchapter XVI speaks primarily in terms of eligibility for SSI benefits, the Medicare fraction focuses on whether an individual is entitled to such benefits. Nothing turns on this difference. In Empire Health, we treated the word “entitled” in the Medicare statute (including the Medicare fraction) as synonymous with “qualifying” for or “being eligible . . . for benefits.” 597 U. S., at 435. See also Webster’s Third New International Dictionary 758 (1986) (defining “entitle” as “to give a right or legal title to” or to “qualify (one) for something”); id., at 736 (defining “eligible” as “fitted or qualified to be chosen or used” or “entitled to something”). This case also involves the Medicare fraction, so we follow the same course. See Brown v. Gardner, 513 U. S. 115, 118 (1994) (noting that the presumption of consistent usage is “surely at its most vigorous when a term is repeated within a given sentence”).
 We therefore conclude that an individual is “entitled to [SSI] benefits . . . under subchapter XVI” when she is eligible to receive an SSI cash payment. And because eligibility is determined on a monthly basis, an individual is considered “entitled to [SSI] benefits” for purposes of the Medicare  fraction only if she is eligible for such benefits during the month of her hospitalization.
III
 The hospitals advance two primary arguments for reading the phrase “entitled to [SSI] benefits . . . under subchapter XVI” more broadly. First, they characterize SSI benefits as encompassing noncash benefits for which eligibility is not determined on a monthly basis. Second, the hospitals, joined by the dissent, argue that eligibility for SSI benefits persists until a person must reapply for them, which occurs after 12 consecutive months of ineligibility for a cash payment. See §1383(j)(1)(B).
A
 As the hospitals see it, SSI benefits include both cash and noncash benefits—specifically, vocational rehabilitation services and continued Medicaid coverage.4 And a patient remains eligible for these benefits, the hospitals assert, even in months when the patient does not receive a cash payment.
 The hospitals’ theory stumbles out of the gate, because neither vocational rehabilitation services nor continued Medicaid coverage fits the description of a “supplementa[l] security income” benefit. §1395ww(d)(5)(F)(vi)(I) (emphasis added). And even beyond that self-evident point, none of these benefits is housed “under subchapter XVI.” Ibid. (emphasis added).
 Begin with the hospitals’ reliance on the Ticket to Work and Self-Sufficiency Program. This program, which is available to people eligible for SSI benefits based on disability or blindness, provides career development support and expanded employment opportunities through state  agencies or private employment networks. See §1320b–19. Because subchapter XI establishes the Ticket to Work program, it is not a benefit “under subchapter XVI.” §1395ww(d)(5)(F)(vi)(I).
 Nor do any of subchapter XVI’s other references to vocational rehabilitation services confer an SSI benefit. Section 1382d(a), for example, requires the Commissioner to refer blind or disabled minors who receive SSI monthly cash payments to the “appropriate State agency administering [a] State program under subchapter V” of the Social Security Act. The remainder of §1382d authorizes SSA to “reimburse” state agencies that administer or supervise “vocational rehabilitation services approved under title I of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973.” §1382d(d). These express cross-references to subchapter V of the Social Security Act and title I of the Rehabilitation Act point to benefits housed elsewhere—not within subchapter XVI.
 The hospitals’ reliance on continued Medicaid coverage also fails. In most States, eligibility for SSI benefits qualifies an individual for Medicaid health coverage. See §1396a(a)(10)(A)(i)(II). Thus, if a person earns excess income and loses her eligibility for SSI payments, she generally also loses access to Medicaid. See ibid.; Baystate Medical Center v. Leavitt, 545 F. Supp. 2d 20, 37, n. 24 (DC 2008). Section 1382h(b) creates a limited exception to that default rule. It provides that “for purposes of subchapter XIX [governing Medicaid], any individual who was determined to be a blind or disabled individual eligible to receive [an SSI] benefit under section 1382” and “who in a subsequent month is ineligible for benefits under this subchapter” due to excess “income” is still “considered to be receiving [SSI] benefits.” §1382h(b). According to the hospitals, the benefit of continued Medicaid coverage “arises solely out of section 1382h(b)” and therefore counts as an SSI benefit. Brief for Petitioners 37.
 The hospitals are mistaken. Section 1382h(b) does not  create a supplemental security income benefit—it aids in the administration of the Medicaid program. (Hence the opening phrase of §1382h(b) states that the provision is “for purposes of subchapter XIX,” which governs Medicaid.) The provision merely allows certain blind or disabled people who are not eligible to receive SSI benefits in a given month to be treated as if they remain eligible for SSI benefits so that they can continue receiving Medicaid benefits. If continued Medicaid coverage is an SSI benefit under subchapter XVI, this is a very odd way of establishing it. Under the hospitals’ theory, this provision confers an SSI benefit on people it simultaneously describes as “ineligible for [SSI] benefits.” §1382h(b). That defies common sense.
B
 The hospitals, joined by the dissent, advance a second argument: Eligibility, even for purely cash benefits, begins when a person enters the SSI system and continues until she has been ineligible for 12 consecutive months, at which point she must submit a new application for benefits. See post, at 7, 11–13 (opinion of JACKSON, J).
 To support this theory, the hospitals and the dissent emphasize that when a person first applies for benefits, she must disclose her income “rate” “for the calendar year.” §1382(a)(1)(A); see post, at 11. True enough. But her “calendar year” income does not render her eligible for SSI benefits, nor does it establish that SSI benefits operate in intervals with a duration longer than one month. For that, she must still show that she meets the requirements for a given month. In fact, a nearby provision of the statute directs eligibility determinations “for a month” to be made “on the basis of the individual’s . . . income, resources, and other relevant characteristics in such month.” §1382(c) (emphasis added). And while the dissent looks to §1383(a)(2)(B)(viii) for help, none is forthcoming. That the Commissioner may “defer (in the case of initial entitlement)  or suspend (in the case of existing entitlement)” a payment of a benefit, §1383(a)(2)(B)(viii), merely addresses a question of timing—it does not, as the dissent suggests, “contemplate a longterm benefits relationship,” post, at 12.
 Nor does the reapplication requirement change the nature of eligibility. Under §1383(j)(1)(B), a once-eligible individual must submit a new application after she has been “ineligible for benefits . . . for a period of 12 consecutive months.” Note that this provision does not say that an individual remains eligible until this 12-month period has lapsed. On the contrary: It states that a person who “was an eligible individual” at one point must reapply after 12 consecutive months of ineligibility. §1383(j)(1)(A) (emphasis added). As the D. C. Circuit observed, “it makes little sense to say that individuals are ‘entitled’ to the benefit in months when they are not even eligible for it.” 80 F. 4th, at 353.5
 Leaning on Empire Health, which dealt with Medicare Part A, the hospitals and the dissent urge us to think of SSI benefits as an “income-insurance program.” Brief for Petitioners 41; see post, at 16–17. The shoe does not fit. Insurance programs generally “provid[e] basic protection against [certain future] costs,” including, in the case of Medicare Part A, “the costs of hospital, related post-hospital, home  health services, and hospice care.” §1395c (describing Medicare Part A as an “insurance program”). SSI benefits, by contrast, do not provide an ongoing backstop against unexpected costs—they operate as a welfare payment that directly subsidizes recipients’ income. See Schweiker, 450 U. S., at 223 (describing SSI as “provid[ing] a subsistence allowance”); Bowen v. Galbreath, 485 U. S. 74, 75 (1988) (describing SSI as a “welfare program”).
 Notwithstanding these differences, the hospitals and the dissent insist that consistency with Empire Health requires us to reject HHS’s interpretation. See Brief for Petitioners 19–21; post, at 14–17. Recall that in Empire Health, we interpreted “ ‘entitled to [Medicare Part A] benefits’ ” to mean “all those qualifying for the program, regardless of whether they are receiving Medicare payments for part or all of a hospital stay.” 597 U. S., at 445 (quoting §1395ww(d)(5)(F)(vi)(I); alteration in original). So too here, the hospitals and the dissent assert: Being “entitled to [SSI] benefits” means that a patient is entitled to SSI benefits even if she does not qualify for a payment during the month of hospitalization.6
 Yet rather than supporting this interpretation, Empire Health cuts against it. We defined the entitlement to benefits under Medicare Part A after carefully examining the prerequisites and characteristics of that particular benefit. See id., at 435–439. Medicare Part A, we observed, provides automatic and ongoing health insurance to individuals over the age of 65 or who have a chronic disability. Id., at 435– 436. And we explained that the Medicare Part A entitlement “never goes away” unless a beneficiary’s chronic “disability diminishes,” and that “the stoppage of payment for any given service cannot be thought to affect the broader statutory entitlement to Part A benefits.” Id., at 437. For example, even if a patient “hit some limit on coverage” for eye care under Part A, the “policy [would] pay for more eye care in the next coverage period and meanwhile will pay for [a] knee replacement.” Ibid.
 Just as our decision in Empire Health turned on the specific features of Medicare Part A, this case turns on the specific features of SSI benefits under subchapter XVI. And a comparison of the two programs reveals critical distinctions. Again, while Medicare Part A benefits extend beyond specific payments for any given medical need, SSI benefits under subchapter XVI consist of monthly cash payments and nothing more. And while Medicare Part A’s entitlement is automatic and ongoing (with the exception of a disability that diminishes), the SSI benefit is neither: Recipients must apply for and be deemed eligible for benefits, and recipients can (and do) fluctuate in and out of eligibility depending on their income and resources from one month to the next. Consistency with Empire Health’s benefit-focused analysis thus requires us to recognize and give effect to the differences between Medicare Part A and SSI benefits.
C
 Finally, invoking statutory purpose, the hospitals and the dissent insist that their interpretation of “entitled to [SSI] benefits . . . under subchapter XVI” best accords with “Congress’s ultimate goal [of] provid[ing] hospitals that serve the neediest among us with the appropriate level of critical funds.” Post, at 2. (Indeed, the dissent frames its argument as one primarily about the statute’s purpose and only secondarily about its text.) They regard our reading as inconsistent with the overall purpose of the Medicare fraction  and DSH adjustment, because people who happen not to qualify for an SSI cash payment in a given month are unlikely to be any healthier or less costly to treat from one month to the next. As they see it, including these patients in the numerator of the Medicare fraction better measures a hospital’s burden, ensuring that the hospital receives “the appropriate level of critical funds.” Ibid.
 This argument overlooks that Congress chose a specific means to advance its end of better funding hospitals that care for a disproportionate percentage of needy Medicare patients. It could have chosen another. For instance, it could have captured the number of poor Medicare patients by relying on proof of annual income. (That measure might increase the numerator and therefore the reimbursement rate.) Alternatively, it could have more precisely isolated the expensive-to-treat Medicare patients by using not only their annual incomes, but also their health histories. (That measure might decrease the numerator and therefore the reimbursement rate.) But instead of choosing one of these (or some other) option, Congress decided to approximate a hospital’s share of expensive-to-treat Medicare patients by using the patient’s entitlement to SSI benefits under subchapter XVI. That is not a perfect measure of income—but neither is income a perfect measure of whether a patient is more costly to treat. In the end, the Medicare fraction and ultimate DSH adjustment reflect a balance of multiple competing interests, including increased funding for hospitals, administrability, efficiency, and allocation of finite resources.
 So yes, Congress sought to increase the reimbursement rate for hospitals that care for a disproportionate share of low-income Medicare patients. But as we have explained many times before, “[n]o statute pursues a single policy at all costs, and we are not free to rewrite this statute (or any other) as if it did.” Bartenwerfer v. Buckley, 598 U. S. 69, 81 (2023); Luna Perez v. Sturgis Public Schools, 598 U. S.  142, 150 (2023) (“no law ‘ “pursues its . . . purpose[s] at all costs” ’ ” (alterations in original)); American Express Co. v. Italian Colors Restaurant, 570 U. S. 228, 234 (2013) (same); Kucana v. Holder, 558 U. S. 233, 252 (2010) (same); Rodriguez v. United States, 480 U. S 522, 525–526 (1987) (per curiam) (same). We must determine how Congress chose to pursue its objective. Henson v. Santander Consumer USA Inc., 582 U. S. 79, 89 (2017) (“Legislation is, after all, the art of compromise, the limitations expressed in statutory terms often the price of passage”). And here, Congress made a specific choice: For purposes of the Medicare fraction, an individual is “entitled to [SSI] benefits” when she is eligible to receive an SSI cash payment during the month of her hospitalization. §1395ww(d)(5)(F)(vi)(I). We must respect the formula that Congress prescribed.
*  *  *
 For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals.
It is so ordered.

Notes
1  Although the Medicare fraction employs the phrase “supplementary security income,” §1395ww(d)(5)(F)(vi)(I) (emphasis added), subchapter XVI refers to this benefit as “supplemental security income,” §1381 (emphasis added). Despite the slight variation in wording, these two phrases refer to the same benefit.
2   To calculate the number of people eligible for SSI benefits in a particular month, HHS obtains data from the Social Security Administration (SSA) that seeks to “captur[e] all SSI-entitled individuals during the month(s) that they are entitled to receive SSI benefits.” 75 Fed. Reg. 50281. SSA collects this data by identifying certain “status codes” that indicate whether a person was entitled to SSI benefits during a particular month. Ibid. As part of a 2010 rulemaking, HHS evaluated various codes used by SSA and concluded that three codes (C01, M01, and M02) capture the relevant population of those entitled to a monthly SSI cash benefit. Ibid. Code C01 represents SSI enrollees who receive an automatic cash payment, and codes M01 and M02 represent SSI enrollees whose cash payments are managed manually. See Advocate Christ Medical Center v. Becerra, 80 F. 4th 346, 350, n. 1 (CADC 2023). As part of that rulemaking, HHS rejected a proposal to begin using additional SSA codes that, according to the commenter, “represent individuals who [are] eligible for SSI, but not eligible for SSI payments” in a given month, including because the individual is in “suspended” status. 75 Fed. Reg. 50280–50281; see 20 CFR §§416.1320–416.1330, 416.1339 (2024) (describing suspension of benefits payments). In rejecting this proposal, HHS explained that “none of the SSI status codes . . . mentioned would be used to describe an individual who was entitled to receive SSI benefits during the month that one of those status codes was used.” 75 Fed Reg. 50281. This case does not present the question whether HHS correctly includes only three SSI status codes as part of its calculation for the Medicare fraction. Below, the D. C. Circuit declined to consider whether HHS “unreasonably excluded from the Medicare fraction individuals assigned codes ‘S’ and ‘E02’ ” because the hospitals raised the argument for the first time in their reply brief. 80 F. 4th, at 354. We too decline to consider this issue.
3  See also §1382(h) (describing rules for “determining eligibility for, and the amount of, benefits payable” to individuals who receive other types of financial assistance); §1382f(a) (providing an “[i]ncrease of dollar amounts” of SSI benefits based on cost-of-living adjustments (boldface deleted)); §1383(b)(1)(A) (providing “appropriate adjustments in future payments” in the case of overpayments or underpayments of SSI benefits).
4  In the court below, the hospitals pressed Medicare Part D’s prescription drug subsidy as another noncash SSI benefit. Because the hospitals have abandoned their reliance on that program, we do not address it.
5  Moreover, this provision appears to be a housekeeping measure: Added roughly 14 years after SSI benefits were established, it ties the reapplication process to SSA’s longstanding practice of removing people from its database after 12 months of ineligibility. See 101 Stat. 3576; Tr. of Oral Arg. 60. Nor do other housekeeping provisions demonstrate that eligibility for SSI benefits is determined on something other than a monthly basis. See, e.g., §1383(e)(1)(B)(ii)(II)(bb) (ensuring SSA’s access to benefit recipient’s financial information until “the cessation of the recipient’s eligibility for benefits under this subchapter”); §1382c(a)(3) (H)(ii)(I) (requiring SSA to review, at least “once every 3 years,” “the continued eligibility for benefits under this subchapter of each individual who has not attained 18 years of age and is eligible for such benefits by reason of an impairment . . . likely to improve”).
6  The dissent also criticizes our reading of the statute on the ground that it excludes from the Medicare fraction’s numerator certain patients who fail to receive payment during their month of hospitalization due to reasons unrelated to income. See post, at 9. But Congress’s decision to exclude certain individuals from eligibility for SSI benefits under subchapter XVI reflects that “the SSI program is broad in its reach, [but] its coverage is not complete.” Schweiker v. Wilson, 450 U. S. 221, 224 (1981). And again, we take no position on whether HHS has unreasonably excluded particular codes from the Medicare fraction.

 JUSTICE JACKSON, with whom JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR joins, dissenting.
 Providing quality healthcare to low-income patients can be costly. When Congress established Medicare’s hospital-reimbursement system, it recognized that people with low incomes tend to have comparatively worse health conditions and health outcomes than wealthier people, and was clear eyed about the fact that, as a result, “[h]ospitals that serve a disproportionate share of low-income patients have higher medicare costs.” H. R. Rep. No. 99–241, p. 16 (1985). To account for the variable costs attributable to the healthcare needs of different socioeconomic populations, Congress opted to reimburse hospitals that have a “disproportionate share” of low-income patients at a different (greater) rate than other hospitals.
 This case concerns the formula that Congress uses to identify and compensate those hospitals. The majority and I are in considerable agreement about key aspects of the statutory provision at issue. We agree that the point of the “disproportionate share” Medicare formula is to identify hospitals that serve a disproportionate number of low-income patients. We agree that the formula looks to the Supplemental Security Income (SSI) program—a benefits program  for low-income Americans that entitles certain individuals to receive cash payments from the Government—and counts the number of a hospital’s Medicare-eligible patients who are also “entitled to” SSI. We agree that, under the SSI program, eligibility for a cash payment in a given month turns on a person’s monthly income. And we agree that, if the SSI program operates like Medicare Part A, our decision in Becerra v. Empire Health Foundation, for Valley Hospital Medical Center, 597 U. S. 424 (2022), would control the outcome of this case, and would require us to rule for the hospitals.
 All that said, the majority’s interpretation of Medicare’s disproportionate-share formula is based upon a fundamental misunderstanding of how SSI’s cash-benefit program works. And that misunderstanding has led the majority to evaluate the Medicare statute without regard to the function of the formula’s reference to the SSI program, causing it to reach the wrong conclusion.
 To be specific: When Congress created Medicare’s disproportionate-share formula, it looked to SSI’s cash- benefits program for a reason. No one disputes that Congress’s ultimate goal was to provide hospitals that serve the neediest among us with the appropriate level of critical funds. The only logical basis for the formula’s reliance on SSI, then, is to draw from that program’s pre-existing pool of individuals that have already been designated as our society’s neediest—not to assess the wholly irrelevant fact of whether any such individual actually received a cash payment under the SSI program during the month of their hospitalization. The majority’s interpretation both ignores this critical context and endorses an interpretation of the Medicare formula that arbitrarily undercounts a hospital’s low-income patients.
 In short, under the majority’s reading, Congress’s reference to the SSI scheme in the Medicare statute serves no rational purpose. Worse still, the majority seems to think  that a statutory formula specifically designed to authorize payments to certain hospitals in greater amounts is best read to affect the arbitrary denial of those additional funds. Respectfully, I dissent.
I
 “The Medicare program provides Government-funded health insurance to over 64 million elderly or disabled Americans.” Empire Health, 597 U. S., at 428. The program generally works by reimbursing hospitals for their treatment of Medicare beneficiaries. See 42 U. S. C. §1395ww(d). To incentivize hospitals to treat patients in the most efficient manner, Congress reimburses hospitals for the services they provide at a fixed rate that turns on a patient’s diagnosis rather than the hospital’s actual costs. Empire Health, 597 U. S., at 429.
 But Congress also recognized that some hospitals have it harder than others. Based on empirical research, it specifically observed that “[h]ospitals that serve a disproportionate share of low-income patients have higher medicare costs,” and that this was so for two primary reasons. H. R. Rep. No. 99–241, at 16; see also Empire Health, 597 U. S., at 429. First, low-income patients tend to be in poorer health to begin with, and have more complications after medical procedures than patients who are wealthier. H. R. Rep. No. 99–241, at 16. Second, hospitals that see a significant number of low-income patients often have to employ extra personnel, such as social workers and interpreters, in order to serve this population, adding to a hospital’s fixed costs. Ibid.
 Congress thus reasonably decided that those hospitals that have a disproportionate share of low-income patients should receive enhanced Medicare reimbursements. Empire Health, 597 U. S., at 429. And, notably, by compensating for the disparity in treatment costs, Congress hoped to “encourag[e] hospitals to treat low-income patients.” Ibid.
  To accomplish Congress’s fair-reimbursement objectives, the hospitals with a disproportionate share of low- income patients first had to be identified. One option would have been to require all hospitals to track their patients’ incomes and report them to the Government. H. R. Rep. No. 99–241, at 17. But this would have added administrative overhead to already burdened hospitals. Ibid. So, instead, Congress devised a formula that could be used to calculate the percentage of a hospital’s patients who are low income using administrative data already in the Government’s possession. See §1395ww(d)(5)(F)(vi).
 As the majority helpfully explains, part of that formula—referred to herein as the “Medicare fraction”—calculates the percentage of a hospital’s Medicare-eligible patients who have low incomes. The base of that fraction counts the total number of days Medicare patients spent in the hospital. Ante, at 4. The numerator counts the number of days “ ‘attributable to Medicare patients who are poor,’ ” as determined by their entitlement to SSI benefits. Ibid.
 We took this case to decide who falls within the numerator. That is, which hospital patients are “entitled to [SSI] benefits” for purposes of the disproportionate-share formula? §1395ww(d)(5)(F)(vi)(I). This seems like a narrow, technical question. But the stakes of the answer are quite high for hospitals because the greater the number of a hospital’s patients who fall within the numerator, the more Medicare-reimbursement money that hospital will receive.
II
 The majority starts off on the right foot. “To determine when a person is ‘entitled to supplementary security income benefits,’ ” “we must know what the benefits are.” Ante, at 6 (quoting §1395ww(d)(5)(F)(vi)(I)). But it quickly missteps. According to the majority, because SSI entitles individuals to “cash benefits,” and the eligibility for those benefits “is determined on a monthly basis,” ante, at 7, the  Medicare fraction counts only those patients who are eligible for a cash payment under SSI during the month of their hospitalization. This conclusion misunderstands both the benefit that SSI provides and also, importantly, the reason why Congress used SSI as its proxy for identifying low-income patients.
A
 The regulations accompanying the SSI statute state that “[t]he basic purpose underlying the [SSI] program is to assure a minimum level of income for people who are age 65 or over, or who are blind or disabled and who do not have sufficient income and resources to maintain a standard of living at the established Federal minimum income level.” 20 CFR §416.110 (2024). We have likewise explained elsewhere that “[t]he SSI program establishes a federally guaranteed minimum income for the aged, blind, and disabled.” Schweiker v. Hogan, 457 U. S. 569, 581–582 (1982).
 At a high level, the SSI program works as follows. Persons who are over 65, blind, or disabled may apply and will be enrolled in the SSI program if their annual income and financial resources are below a certain designated level. 42 U. S. C. §§1381, 1382(a)(1), (c)(7). Once approved—and until that enrollment is terminated—an individual who is enrolled in the SSI program is guaranteed an annual income above the federal minimum. See §1382(b). This does not necessarily mean such an enrollee will receive a check from the Government each month (or even at all)—that depends on other specified factors. See §1382(c). But if in any month an enrollee’s income drops below the rate required to hit the federal minimum, the Government will pick up the slack by sending them a check. See ibid.
 I pause here to note that participation in the SSI program is thus highly beneficial to enrollees, regardless of whether they happen to need and receive a check in any particular month. This is so because being enrolled in SSI provides  participants with meaningful reassurance. Poverty in America is a plague of uncertainty marked by persistent instability—what others have called “the constant fear that it will get even worse.” M. Desmond, Poverty, By America 17 (2023). The problem is not just that one’s income is too low; it is that one’s income, such as it is, is highly volatile. “For scores of American workers, wages are . . . wobbly, fluctuating wildly not only year to year but month to month, even week to week.” Id., at 16. As one woman living on the edge of poverty described her situation: “ ‘[E]very day and every night when I’m trying to fall asleep, there’s this worry hanging. . . . How am I gonna get it done? How am I gonna stretch to get these bills paid? If one extra thing happens—.’ ”  D. Shipler, The Working Poor 25 (2004).
 Congress understood this reality when it set out to construct an income-related social safety net for the population SSI covers. Indeed, the SSI program was specifically designed to address the often debilitating state of low-income volatility. If a person hovering at the poverty threshold is enrolled in the SSI program, she has peace of mind that if she misses work because her car breaks down, her child falls ill, or her work hours are suddenly slashed, she will still be able to pay the bills because the Government will provide her with some cash, if needed. That is the true “benefit” of SSI—one less thing to worry about.
 This basic understanding of the SSI program also helps to clarify the beneficiaries (i.e., it explains who is “entitled to” SSI benefits for purposes of that statutory scheme): anyone who, per the threshold statutory criteria, is protected by SSI’s safety net in the first place. In other words, an “entitled” person is any individual who has a right to receive SSI payments when his income falls below the federal minimum.
 The text and structure of the SSI statute plainly comport with this understanding of both the SSI benefit and what it  means to be “entitled” thereto. The first substantive provision of the SSI subchapter—notably titled “Basic entitlement to benefits”—makes a promise: “Every aged, blind, or disabled individual who is determined . . . to be eligible on the basis of his income and resources shall, in accordance with and subject to the provisions of this subchapter, be paid benefits.” §1381a (emphasis added; boldface deleted). That is clear enough. But which individuals are “eligible on the basis of [their] income and resources”? That question is answered by the subsequent provision, §1382(a), which explains that any “aged, blind, or disabled individual” with an annual income and financial resources below a certain threshold “shall be an eligible individual for purposes of this subchapter.”
 Section 1382 then goes on to explain what an eligible individual is eligible for under this program. Subsection (b) guarantees each eligible individual payments from the Government up to the statutorily defined federal minimum income level over the course of a year, reduced by that individual’s countable income for that year. §1382(b). And subsection (c) provides that eligible individuals will receive a cash payment in any month in which their monthly income falls below the amount that would be required for them to earn the federal minimum over the course of a year. §1382(c)(1).
 Putting it all together: The SSI statute distinguishes between an entitlement to be enrolled in the SSI program—promised in §1381a with eligibility criteria laid out in §1382(a)—and the right to receive a payment under the program. Anyone who is in the former bucket gets the quite valuable safety-net benefit of being enrolled in SSI (and the peace of mind that comes with it), whether or not they actually receive a check from the Government in any particular month.
 B
 Because the majority fails to appreciate the programmatic nature of SSI, it reduces SSI’s benefit to the monthly check—and nothing more. From that premise, the majority concludes that all Congress cared about when measuring a hospital’s low-income population for purposes of Medicare’s disproportionate-share formula was the number of patients who received a check during the month of their hospital stay. But the majority also admits that the point of Medicare’s disproportionate-share formula is to identify “ ‘hospitals serving an “unusually high percentage of low-income patients.” ’ ” Ante, at 2. And whether an individual received a check from the Government in a given month does not track—and, indeed, has little to do with—the broader “low-income” category of patients. The result is an interpretation of the formula that not only strangely excludes indisputably low-income patients, but does so arbitrarily.
 Imagine a woman who has been eligible for SSI payments for years and works at a retail store—I will call her Ann. In January, Ann picks up a few night shifts, which pay more than her usual day shifts. Cf. Shipler, The Working Poor, at 65. That extra income bumps her above the SSI cash-payment threshold so she does not get a payment in January. But in February (and March, and April, and May), when her schedule returns to normal, her income falls back below the threshold. In the majority’s view, whether Ann counts as a low-income patient for purposes of the disproportionate-share formula depends on the happenstance of her hospitalization. If she has a heart attack in February, she’s in. But if her heart fails in January, she’s out.
 Why would Congress have intended to exclude Ann from the hospital’s count of low-income patients in January but include her in February? The answer is simple: It didn’t. After all, the disproportionate-share formula is not about Ann’s own personal cash flow—Congress was not trying to  identify those patients who lack cash on hand. Instead, as all agree, the formula is trying to count those patients who will be costlier to treat due to the health impacts of poverty. From the hospital’s (and society’s) perspective, there is no cost difference between treating Ann in January (when she had a bit more cash) or treating her in February (when she had a bit less). In either month, in terms of the hospital’s comparatively greater treatment costs, Ann qualifies as a low-income patient.
 The irrationality of the majority’s reading does not end there. Under the majority’s view, also falling outside the Medicare formula’s numerator are patients who happen to be hospitalized during the first month they are eligible for SSI, because, by statute, SSI payments do not kick in until the second month of eligibility. See §1382(c)(7). Other quirks of SSI’s statutory scheme—such as a provision preventing persons in Medicaid-funded nursing homes from getting an SSI payment in any month in which they have more than $30 in income, §1382(e)(1)(B)—likewise mean that many of the lowest-income patients are arbitrarily excluded from the disproportionate-share formula’s count. Neither of these circumstances has anything whatsoever to do with how costly it will be to provide such patients with quality healthcare.1
 The majority does not mention these incongruities, let alone justify them. Instead, it shrugs away all of the apparent oddities of its interpretation, blithely noting that “ ‘no  statute pursues a single policy at all costs.’ ” Ante, at 15 (brackets omitted). I would think the People’s representatives deserve more credit than to have this Court conclude they intentionally enacted a statute that does not reach its aims and operates so arbitrarily that it makes no sense.
 In the majority’s view, my way of analyzing the relevant statutes impermissibly elevates purpose over text, because it “overlooks that Congress chose a specific means to advance its end.” Ante, at 15. But that contention simply begs the question before us; what we are doing now is trying to discern what it was that Congress “chose” when it referenced the SSI program while crafting the Medicare fraction. The majority apparently believes it can figure that out without considering what the Medicare fraction was designed to accomplish—it just insists, largely by ipse dixit, that Congress “chose” a proxy for low-income status that asks whether a patient received an SSI check during the month of their hospital stay. Ante, at 8–9, 15. My response is simply, why would Congress possibly make that choice? The illogic of the majority’s interpretation strongly signals that what the majority believes Congress “chose” is not actually what Congress intended or accomplished.
 There is also no need to conclude that Congress intentionally selected such an irrational and arbitrary measurement when there is another equally (if not more) plausible interpretation available: that Congress intended to count those patients who were enrolled in the SSI program at the time the hospital served them. Statutes “are not inert exercises in literary composition,” but “instruments of government.” United States v. Shirey, 359 U. S. 255, 260 (1959). We disrespect that instrument—and the coequal branch of Government that has enacted it—when we fail to understand, or appreciate, the logic of the laws Congress designs.
 C
 There is yet another reason the majority’s myopic approach to interpreting statutes has yielded the wrong result in this case. As the majority envisions the SSI program, a patient’s entitlement to SSI toggles off and on each month, depending on her cash flow. That view of how the program operates is flatly inconsistent with the fully contextualized reading that I have laid out in Part II–A. It also conflicts with the statute’s plain text, which clearly contemplates an SSI entitlement that extends beyond a single month.
 To understand how the majority goes awry on this point, start where the majority does: with the language of §1382(c)—a provision that explains how and when SSI cash benefits will be paid. See ante, at 7. By starting there, the majority essentially ignores §§1382(a) and (b), which plainly address who is entitled to SSI benefits and what they are qualified to receive due to that entitlement. See also Schweiker v. Wilson, 450 U. S. 221, 223, n. 2 (1981) (“To be eligible for SSI benefits,” a person’s “income and resources must be below the levels specified in . . . 42 U. S. C. §1382(a)”); Sullivan v. Zebley, 493 U. S. 521, 524 (1990) (“A person is eligible for SSI benefits if his income and financial resources are below a certain level, §1382(a), and if he is ‘disabled’ ”). Moreover, and importantly for present purposes, subsection (a) eligibility looks to an individual’s income over the course of a “calendar year”—not her income in any particular month. §1382(a)(1)(A). Thus, the text of this statute, read as a whole, plainly establishes that eligibility for SSI benefits operates on a longer time horizon than the majority acknowledges.
 Other provisions further demonstrate that whether someone is “entitled to” SSI benefits does not turn on their income in a single month. After an individual applies for SSI and is deemed eligible under §1382(a), she need not apply again the next month—or, actually, any month thereaf ter—because her eligibility for benefits lasts until her income is too high for one full year, §1383(j)(1); 20 CFR §416.1335, or until her enrollment is terminated for some other reason, §1383(e)(1)(A); 20 CFR §§416.1331, 416.1333–416.1334. The statute also seems to contemplate a longterm benefits relationship, insofar as it permits the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) in certain circumstances to “defer (in the case of initial entitlement) or suspend (in the case of existing entitlement)” SSI benefits—a distinction that only makes sense if an individual’s entitlement to SSI lasts beyond a single month. §1383(a)(2)(B)(viii) (emphasis added); see also §1382c(a)(3)(H)(ii)(I) (referring to an individual’s “continued eligibility” for benefits over the course of multiple years).
 If all that is still not enough to permit the majority to accurately discern the broader confines of this program, consider the fact that HHS requires SSI applicants to grant the agency permission to access their financial records so that HHS can automatically monitor their income. §1383(e)(1)(B)(ii); 20 CFR §416.207. That authorization lasts until “the cessation of the recipient’s eligibility for benefits under this subchapter.” §1383(e)(1)(B)(ii)(II)(bb). But if eligibility for SSI benefits were a monthly determination, the give-us-your-records provision would accomplish nothing. It would do the agency no good to have permission to access those records for one month and one month only.
 The practical realities of SSI administration further demonstrate that the SSI entitlement is not determined month by month. For example, SSI benefits are paid on the first day of the month—an individual receives his February payment on February 1st. 20 CFR §416.502. With its month-only entitlement perspective, the majority thus apparently surmises that HHS regularly pays benefits without knowing whether the recipient is eligible for SSI at all. Any such policy would be surprisingly irresponsible. But if  SSI is a program that lasts beyond a single month, day-one payments are both rational and administratively feasible. Recall that we are talking about people who are desperately in need of cash to pay their monthly bills; this explains the agency’s practice of providing prompt, prospective payments, which the aforementioned income monitoring facilitates. Moreover, as I have explained, once an individual is approved for SSI, he is entitled to receive such prospective payments, as needed, until his enrollment is terminated. By adopting a broader time horizon than the single month in which the payment is made, the agency can get the money out to the needy individual and then subsequently smooth out any over- (or under-) payments it makes, by checking the person’s actual salary for the month in question and, if necessary, adjusting the amount it pays in later months. See §1383(b).
 The majority simply ignores these kinds of programmatic features that cut against its reading. And the unhelpful statutory provisions that the majority does acknowledge get short shrift in its opinion; in a footnote, the majority bats them away as mere legislative “housekeeping.” Ante, at 12, n. 5. I grant that it is easier to duck Congress’s handiwork than to explain the implications of its various policy choices. But if the majority is going to base its interpretation exclusively on what Congress “chose” when it used the term “eligibility,” it must grapple with all such usages of that term in the statute in question—not just those that support its preferred reading.2
 Notably, the design of the statute that creates the SSI program—basic criteria establishing an entitlement to a  benefit, pursuant to which individuals are eligible for a payment under certain conditions that are delineated elsewhere—is not unique to SSI. Consider veterans benefits, for example. A veteran “with the requisite period of military service becomes ‘entitled to’ ” certain educational benefits, “typically in the form of a stipend or tuition payments.” Rudisill v. McDonough, 601 U. S. 294, 299 (2024) (emphasis added). But just because a person is entitled to those benefits does not mean she will ever receive them; there are hoops through which she must jump and conditions she must satisfy to be eligible to receive a payment. Id., at 300–301.
 Or consider Medicare Part A. “When a person turns 65,” she “becomes ‘entitled’ to” Medicare Part A benefits. Empire Health, 597 U. S., at 428 (quoting 42 U. S. C. §§426(a)–(b)). There, too, entitlement does not guarantee payment—a person may be entitled to Medicare Part A benefits yet never receive a single cent, perhaps because he is covered by private health insurance, or because he has hit some statutory cap on care. 597 U. S., at 432. As this Court has recognized, “[t]he entitlement to [Medicare Part A] benefits” is simply “an entitlement to payment under specified conditions.” Id., at 436 (some emphasis deleted). The same is true of SSI. Compare §426(c)(1) (explaining that “entitlement of an individual” to Medicare Part A benefits “consist[s] of entitlement to have payment made under, and subject to the limitations in, part A”) with §1381a (stating that “[b]asic entitlement to [SSI] benefits” consists of a promise to certain individuals of payment “in accordance with and subject to the provisions of th[e SSI] subchapter” (boldface deleted)).
III
 It was precisely this distinction—between a threshold entitlement to participate in a benefit program, on the one  hand, and a subsequent right to a payment under that program, on the other—that was the linchpin of our interpretation of another part of the disproportionate-share formula just three Terms ago. In Empire Health, we faced a question that is substantially similar to the one the Court decides today: Which patients are “ ‘entitled to’ ” Medicare Part A benefits for purposes of the disproportionate-share formula? 597 U. S., at 428. What is more, the arguments in that case mirrored the arguments we consider now. One side maintained that a patient is “entitled to” such benefits only if she had actually received a Medicare payment; the other insisted that a patient is so entitled if he was eligible for the Medicare Part A program, no payment necessary. See id., at 432–433. Notably, however, the valence of the arguments was flipped—in Empire Health, it was the hospitals that insisted payment was required, while the Government asserted program eligibility sufficed. Ibid.
 We sided with the Government. A patient is “ ‘entitled to’ ” Medicare Part A benefits, we held, if she “meet[s] the basic statutory criteria” for the Medicare Part A program, whether or not she “actually receiv[ed] payment for a given day’s treatment.” Id., at 435. For purposes of the disproportionate-share formula, we said, a patient’s receipt of payment is beside the point. All the formula cares about is whether a patient qualifies for the program that entitles her to payment under specified conditions. Id., at 436.
 Exactly that same logic should have carried the day here. A patient is “entitled to” SSI benefits for purposes of the disproportionate-share formula if she “meets the basic statutory criteria” for the SSI program, whether or not she “actually receiv[ed an SSI] payment” in the relevant month. Id., at 432, 435. In other words, just as with Medicare Part A, statutory entitlement to SSI “coexists with limitations on payment.” Id., at 436.
 Our reasoning in Empire Health resulted in hospitals receiving less money by operation of the Medicare fraction. Id., at 444. Applied here, that same logic requires them to receive more, because it places more patients in the numerator of the Medicare fraction. But instead of simply following Empire Health where it leads, the majority diverges from its clear and plainly applicable holding. In the majority’s view, although a patient need not receive a Medicare Part A payment to be “entitled to” Medicare Part A for purposes of the disproportionate-share formula, she must receive an SSI payment to be “entitled to” SSI under that same calculation.
 To justify this puzzling departure, the majority identifies two “critical distinctions” that it says distinguish SSI from Medicare Part A and thus make this case different from Empire Health. Ante, at 14. First, the majority says that Medicare Part A benefits “extend beyond specified payments for any given medical need,” whereas SSI benefits “consist of monthly cash payments and nothing more.” Ibid. I’ve already explained why that characterization of SSI is wrong: The SSI benefit is not simply the payment itself, but the promise of a payment in one’s time of need. Supra, at 5–6. SSI thus operates just like income insurance. Enrolled individuals are promised a payout, should the relevant triggering event—monthly income below the threshold—occur.
 The majority rejects this commonsense conclusion based on superficial mischaracterizations of the SSI program and what it means to the people who rely on it. So, SSI is commonly described as a “ ‘welfare program,’ ” ante, at 13—so what? That label does not change the fact that this welfare program operates more like insurance than a subsidy. The majority also seems to believe that insurance programs may protect beneficiaries only against increased costs—not decreased income. Ibid. But why is that the case? Economically speaking, increased costs and decreased income are two sides of the same coin. The only difference is the precipitating factor, and, of course, the fact that the decreased- income species of insurance acknowledges the reality of income insecurity.
 The second declared distinction is the majority’s contention that Medicare Part A is “automatic and ongoing” while SSI is not. Ante, at 14. This seems faulty from the start, since the majority concedes that disabled individuals can lose their entitlement to Medicare Part A if their disability diminishes. Ibid. Thus, it is questionable whether Medicare Part A is, in fact, “ongoing.” In any event, the majority fails to explain why this “ongoing” distinction makes any difference. The question before us is whether a person is “entitled to” SSI for purposes of the disproportionate-share formula, not whether a person must reapply to become so entitled, or whether it is possible to be excised from this benefit program’s rolls.
 Ultimately, then, neither of the “critical” distinctions that the majority identifies between Medicare Part A and SSI are critical at all. So, in the absence of any principled basis for distinguishing this case from Empire Health, the majority falls back on pithy rhetoric, quipping that “ ‘it makes little sense to say that individuals are “entitled” to the benefit in months when they are not even eligible for it.’ ” Ante, at 12. Again, this characterization misrepresents the real benefit of SSI. It is also noteworthy that, while some on this Court embraced a similar argument in Empire Health, they did so in dissent. See 597 U. S., at 447–448 (opinion of KAVANAUGH, J.) (arguing that a patient could not be considered “entitled to” a Medicare Part A benefit “if the patient by statute could not” receive a payment). The majority view in Empire Health fully appreciated the insurance-like nature of the Medicare program, and its reasoning applies full bore to the question we address today.
*  *  *
 The decision the majority has made in this case will de prive hospitals serving the neediest among us of critical federal funds that Congress plainly attempted to provide. Hospitals that have a disproportionate share of low-income patients are struggling. Indeed, it is undisputed that systemically undercounting low-income patients for the purposes of the disproportionate-share formula might cause many such hospitals to close their doors entirely, such that patients from our Nation’s poorest communities may not be served at all. Brief for American Hospital Association et al. as Amici Curiae 27–28; Tr. of Oral Arg. 36–38.
 This outcome is not compelled by the text of the Medicare statute or the circumstances that surround it. Rather, it is, unfortunately, directly attributable to the majority’s incurious and context-free method of statutory analysis. Congress’s reference to the SSI program in the Medicare formula has confused the majority into thinking that Congress meant for hospitals serving low-income patients to be reimbursed at lower rates than if their patient population was fully taken into account. So it will now be up to Congress to restate its intention that low-income people have access to quality medical care and that hospitals be compensated accordingly.
 I suspect that such a legislative fix would not be too difficult to craft. But Congress would not need to go that extra mile if this Court’s interpretive practices would just take care to evaluate the text of a statute alongside any indisputable legislative objectives. Here, we should have easily concluded that, for purposes of the disproportionate-share formula used to reimburse hospitals, patients are “entitled to” SSI benefits when they are eligible for and enrolled in the SSI program, as Congress undoubtedly intended.
________________________________________
Notes
1  The Government has at least conceded that its interpretation is not an “actual receipt” rule—a patient will be counted, the Government has promised, even if he doesn’t actually receive an SSI payment in a given month (e.g., because the enrollee moves or the post office loses the check), so long as he “satisfies the statutory requirements for a cash payment during the relevant month in question.” Tr. of Oral Arg. 51. The Government also assured the Court that it would “retroactively” count patients who initially failed to receive a payment in a given month due to an administrative error (such as an erroneous address on file) that was subsequently cured. Id., at 52.
2  For my part, I do not deny that the SSI statute discusses an individual’s “ ‘eligibility for a benefit . . . for a month.’ ” Ante, at 7 (quoting §1382(c)(1)). But, as I’ve explained, that monthly eligibility is meant only to describe the benefit (i.e., the cash payment) that an individual who is entitled to SSI is eligible to receive. Supra, at 7.

___________________________________________________
هنگامی که بیمارستان‌ها خدمات بستری را به ذینفعان مدیکر ارائه می‌دهند، برنامه مدیکر به آن بیمارستان‌ها نرخ ثابتی برای درمان هر بیمار مدیکر پرداخت می‌کند. به ۴۲ قانون ایالات متحده، بخش ۱۳۹۵ww(d)(1)–(4) مراجعه کنید. کنگره همچنین تعدیلات نرخ ویژه بیمارستان‌های مختلف، از جمله تعدیل «سهم نامتناسب بیمارستان» (DSH) را ارائه می‌دهد که بودجه اضافی را برای بیمارستان‌هایی که درصد بالایی از بیماران کم‌درآمد را درمان می‌کنند، ارائه می‌دهد. برای محاسبه تعدیل DSH، وزارت بهداشت و خدمات انسانی (HHS) دو کسر قانونی تجویز شده به نام کسر مدیکر و کسر مدیکید را با هم جمع می‌کند. بخش ۱۳۹۵ww(d)(5)(F)(vi). کسر مدیکر «نشان‌دهنده نسبت بیماران مدیکر بیمارستان است که درآمد کمی دارند» و کسر مدیکید «نشان‌دهنده نسبت بیماران بیمارستان است که واجد شرایط مدیکر نیستند و درآمد کمی دارند». پرونده بِسِرا علیه بنیاد سلامت امپایر، به نفع مرکز پزشکی بیمارستان ولی، 597 U. S. 424, 429–430. وقتی کسر مدیکر به صورت درصد بیان می‌شود و به درصد کسر مدیکید اضافه می‌شود، حاصل جمع، درصد نامتناسب بیمار را به دست می‌دهد. §1395ww(d)(5)(F)(vi). این درصد، به نوبه خود، تعیین می‌کند که آیا یک بیمارستان تعدیل DSH دریافت خواهد کرد یا خیر - و اگر چنین است، چقدر.
در اینجا، صورت کسر مدیکر طبق قانون به صورت «تعداد روزهای بستری [یک] بیمار در بیمارستان» تعریف شده است که به بیمارانی نسبت داده می‌شود که «(برای چنین روزهایی) واجد شرایط دریافت مزایا تحت [مدیکر] بخش A» و «مستحق دریافت مزایای درآمد امنیتی تکمیلی [SSI] ... تحت زیرفصل شانزدهم» بوده‌اند. §1395ww(d)(5)(F)(vi)(I). این دادگاه در امپایر هلث حکم داده است که عبارت «مستحق دریافت مزایای [مدیکر بخش A]» در بخش مدیکر شامل «تمام افراد واجد شرایط این برنامه می‌شود، صرف نظر از اینکه آیا آنها برای بخشی یا تمام مدت بستری در بیمارستان، پرداخت‌های مدیکر را دریافت می‌کنند یا خیر.» 597 U. S.، در 445 (به نقل از §1395ww(d)(5)(F)(vi)(I)؛ تغییر در متن اصلی). اما دادگاه به موضوع مطرح شده در این پرونده - یعنی اینکه کدام بیماران «مستحق دریافت مزایای [SSI] ... تحت زیرفصل شانزدهم» هستند - نپرداخته است. HHS این عبارت را به بیمارانی تفسیر می‌کند که در طول ماهی که در بیمارستان بستری بوده‌اند، حق دریافت پرداخت SSI را دارند. دادخواهان - گروهی متشکل از بیش از ۲۰۰ بیمارستان - اصرار دارند که این عبارت شامل تمام بیمارانی می‌شود که در زمان بستری شدن در سیستم SSI ثبت‌نام کرده‌اند، حتی اگر در طول ماه بستری شدن در بیمارستان، واجد شرایط دریافت پرداخت SSI نبوده باشند. بیمارستان‌ها ادعا می‌کنند که در نتیجه تفسیر نادرست HHS از این عبارت، HHS تعدیل DSH بیمارستان‌ها را اشتباه محاسبه کرده و از سال ۲۰۰۶ تا ۲۰۰۹ بودجه کافی به بیمارستان‌ها اختصاص نداده است. بیمارستان‌ها در هر مرحله از این دعوی، از جمله اخیراً قبل از دادگاه حوزه انتخابیه واشنگتن دی سی، بازنده بوده‌اند. دادگاه حوزه قضایی دی. سی. به این نتیجه رسید که مزایای SSI در «زیرفصل شانزدهم مربوط به پرداخت‌های نقدی برای افراد نیازمند است» و «اینکه بگوییم افراد در ماه‌هایی که حتی واجد شرایط [پرداخت] نیستند، «مستحق» دریافت مزایا هستند، منطقی نیست.» Advocate Christ Medical Center v. Becerra, 80 F. 4th 346, 352–353. دادگاه حکم را پذیرفت.


در محاسبه کسر مدیکر، یک فرد زمانی که واجد شرایط دریافت پرداخت نقدی SSI در طول ماه بستری شدن در بیمارستان باشد، «مستحق دریافت مزایای [SSI]» برای اهداف کسر مدیکر است. صفحات 6–16.

(الف) مزایای SSI مزایای نقدی هستند. به 42 U. S. C. ch. 7, subch. XVI مراجعه کنید. بخش ۱۳۸۱a، که شرایط اساسی دریافت مزایا را شرح می‌دهد، مقرر می‌دارد که «[هر] فردی که بر اساس درآمد و منابع خود واجد شرایط تشخیص داده شود، باید ... مزایا دریافت کند.» (تأکید اضافه شده است.) کلمه «پرداخت شده» به معنای پول نقد است. بخش ۱۳۸۲(b)(1)، که مبلغی را که اداره تأمین اجتماعی باید به افراد واجد شرایط پرداخت کند، مشخص می‌کند که مزایا «با نرخ [مبلغ دلاری خاص] قابل پرداخت خواهد بود.» مزایایی که به دلار محاسبه می‌شوند، به وضوح یک مزیت نقدی هستند. به طور مشابه، بیانیه مدون هدف زیرفصل شانزدهم «ارائه درآمد امنیتی تکمیلی به افراد» است. §۱۳۸۱ (تأکید اضافه شده است). 
همانطور که زیرفصل شانزدهم روشن می‌کند که مزایای SSI مزایای نقدی هستند، همچنین تصریح می‌کند که واجد شرایط بودن برای چنین مزایایی بر اساس ماه تعیین می‌شود.بر اساس hly. بخش 1382(c)(1) مقرر می‌دارد که «واجد شرایط بودن یک فرد برای دریافت مزایا تحت این زیربخش به مدت یک ماه» بر اساس «درآمد، منابع و سایر ویژگی‌های مرتبط فرد در آن ماه» تعیین می‌شود. اشاره قانون به قطع مزایا همچنین به ماه‌های عدم واجد شرایط بودن اشاره دارد و بیان می‌کند که فرد باید پس از «عدم واجد شرایط بودن برای مزایا... برای مدت 12 ماه متوالی» دوباره برای برنامه درخواست دهد. §1383(j)(1)(B). 
در نهایت، اگرچه زیربخش XVI در درجه اول از نظر واجد شرایط بودن برای مزایای SSI صحبت می‌کند، بخش Medicare بر این موضوع تمرکز دارد که آیا فرد واجد شرایط دریافت چنین مزایایی است یا خیر. هیچ چیز به این تفاوت مربوط نمی‌شود. در پرونده Empire Health، دادگاه کلمه «استحقاق» در قانون Medicare را مترادف با «واجد شرایط بودن» برای دریافت مزایا یا «واجد شرایط بودن برای مزایا» دانست. 597 U. S.، صفحه 435. این پرونده همچنین شامل بخش مدیکر می‌شود، بنابراین دادگاه از همین رویه پیروی می‌کند. از آنجا که واجد شرایط بودن برای پرداخت SSI به صورت ماهانه تعیین می‌شود، یک فرد زمانی که در طول ماه بستری شدن در بیمارستان واجد شرایط دریافت چنین مزایایی باشد، برای اهداف بخش مدیکر "مستحق دریافت مزایای [SSI]" در نظر گرفته می‌شود. صفحات 6-9. 
(ب) تعبیر گسترده‌تر بیمارستان‌ها از "مستحق دریافت مزایای [SSI]" با شکست مواجه می‌شود. صفحات 9-16. 
(1) در حالی که بیمارستان‌ها مزایای SSI را شامل مزایای غیرنقدی - به عنوان مثال، خدمات توانبخشی حرفه‌ای و پوشش مداوم مدیکید - می‌دانند، این مزایای غیرنقدی با توصیف مزایای "درآمد امنیتی تکمیلی" مطابقت ندارند. §1395ww(d)(5)(F)(vi)(I) (تأکید اضافه شده است). علاوه بر این، هیچ یک از مزایای غیرنقدی شناسایی‌شده توسط بیمارستان‌ها «تحت زیرفصل شانزدهم» قرار نمی‌گیرد. همانجا (تأکید اضافه شده است). به همین دلیل، اتکای بیمارستان‌ها به برنامه «بلیط کار و خودکفایی» کم است. همچنین هیچ یک از ارجاعات دیگر زیرفصل شانزدهم به خدمات توانبخشی حرفه‌ای، مزایای SSI را اعطا نمی‌کند. بلکه، ارجاعات §1382d به برخی خدمات، به مزایایی اشاره دارد که در جای دیگری قرار دارند، اما در زیرفصل شانزدهم نیستند.


وابستگی بیمارستان‌ها به پوشش مداوم مدیکید طبق §1382h(b) نیز بی‌تاثیر است. در اکثر ایالت‌ها، واجد شرایط بودن برای مزایای SSI، فرد را واجد شرایط پوشش مدیکید می‌کند. در حالی که از دست دادن مزایای SSI عموماً به معنای از دست دادن پوشش مدیکید است، §1382h(b) به افراد خاصی که در یک ماه معین واجد شرایط دریافت مزایای SSI نیستند، اجازه می‌دهد تا با آنها طوری رفتار شود که گویی واجد شرایط دریافت مزایای SSI هستند تا بتوانند به دریافت مدیکید ادامه دهند. اما ماده 1382h(b)، که طبق مفاد آن فقط در مورد Medicaid (یعنی «زیرفصل نوزدهم») اعمال می‌شود، صرفاً به مدیریت برنامه Medicaid کمک می‌کند. این ماده مزایای SSI ایجاد نمی‌کند. صفحات 9-11. 
(2) بیمارستان‌ها استدلال دومی را مطرح می‌کنند مبنی بر اینکه واجد شرایط بودن برای مزایای SSI - حتی برای مزایای صرفاً نقدی - از زمانی شروع می‌شود که فرد وارد سیستم SSI می‌شود و تا زمانی که فرد برای 12 ماه متوالی واجد شرایط دریافت پرداخت SSI نباشد، ادامه می‌یابد. در حالی که درست است که شخصی که برای اولین بار برای مزایا درخواست می‌دهد باید «نرخ» درآمد خود را «برای سال تقویمی» افشا کند، ماده 1382(a)(1)(A)، درآمد «سال تقویمی» او را واجد شرایط مزایای SSI نمی‌کند، و همچنین ثابت نمی‌کند که مزایای SSI در فواصل زمانی با مدت زمان طولانی‌تر از یک ماه اعمال می‌شود. در عوض، قانون به وضوح دستور می‌دهد که تصمیمات مربوط به واجد شرایط بودن، ماهانه و بر اساس «درآمد، منابع و سایر ویژگی‌های مرتبط فرد در آن ماه» گرفته شود. §1382(c) (تأکید اضافه شده است). همچنین الزام درخواست مجدد، ماهیت واجد شرایط بودن را تغییر نمی‌دهد. طبق §1383(j)(1)(B)، فردی که یک بار واجد شرایط بوده است، باید پس از «عدم واجد شرایط بودن برای مزایا... برای مدت 12 ماه متوالی»، درخواست جدیدی ارائه دهد. این ماده بیان نمی‌کند که فرد در این دوره همچنان واجد شرایط باقی می‌ماند؛ بلکه بیان می‌کند که فردی که در یک مقطع «فرد واجد شرایط» بوده است، باید پس از 12 ماه متوالی عدم واجد شرایط بودن، دوباره درخواست دهد. §1383(j)(1)(A) (تأکید اضافه شده است).
بیمارستان‌ها همچنین ادعا می‌کنند که Empire Health از نظریه آنها مبنی بر اینکه «مستحق دریافت مزایای [SSI]» بودن به این معنی است که بیمار حتی اگر در طول ماه بستری واجد شرایط دریافت پرداخت نباشد، واجد شرایط دریافت مزایای SSI است، پشتیبانی می‌کند. اما اینطور نیست. همانطور که Empire Health ویژگی‌های خاص بخش A مدیکر را بررسی کرد، این پرونده نیز ویژگی‌های خاص مزایای SSI را تحت زیرفصل شانزدهم بررسی می‌کند. برخلاف بخش A مدیکر که بیمه درمانی خودکار و مداومی را ارائه می‌دهد که «هرگز از بین نمی‌رود» بدون کاهش معلولیت، Empire Health، 597 U.S.، در صفحه 437، مزایای SSI مستلزم آن است که دریافت‌کنندگان برای مزایا درخواست دهند و واجد شرایط شناخته شوند، و دریافت‌کنندگان می‌توانند (و می‌شوند) بر اساس درآمد و منابع ماهانه واجد شرایط بودن خود را تغییر دهند. بنابراین، مطابق با تحلیل متمرکز بر مزایا توسط Empire Health، دادگاه باید تفاوت‌های بین بخش A مدیکر و مزایای SSI را تشخیص داده و به آنها ترتیب اثر دهد. صفحات 11-14.
(3) در نهایت، با استناد به هدف قانونی، بیمارستان‌ها استدلال می‌کنند که برداشت گسترده آنها از «مزایای [SSI] واجد شرایط» پیشرفت‌های بهتری را برای شرکت به ارمغان می‌آورد.هدف ngress از ارائه بودجه اضافی به بیمارستان‌هایی که به درصد نامتناسبی از بیماران نیازمند مدیکر خدمت می‌کنند، چیست؟ اما «هیچ قانون واحدی به هر قیمتی یک سیاست واحد را دنبال نمی‌کند»، Bartenwerfer v. Buckley, 598 U. S. 69, 81، و دادگاه باید به فرمول خاصی که کنگره تجویز کرده است احترام بگذارد. صفحات 14-16.
80 F. 4th 346، تأیید شده است.

BARRETT, J.، نظر دادگاه را ارائه کرد که در آن ROBERTS, C. J.، و THOMAS, ALITO, KAGAN, GORSUCH، و KAVANAUGH, JJ.، به آن پیوستند. JACKSON, J.، نظر مخالفی ارائه داد که در آن SOTOMAYOR, J.، به آن پیوست.

قاضی بارت نظر دادگاه را بیان کرد. 
برنامه مدیکر، که بیمه درمانی را برای آمریکایی‌های مسن یا معلول فراهم می‌کند، توسط یک قانون به شدت پیچیده اداره می‌شود. بنابراین، جای تعجب نیست که ماده مورد بحث در این پرونده بسیار فنی است: این ماده درصدی را برای محاسبه نرخی که دولت به بیمارستانی که سهم نامتناسبی از بیماران کم‌درآمد مدیکر را درمان می‌کند، پرداخت خواهد کرد، تعیین می‌کند. این درصد با مجموع دو کسر - به اصطلاح کسر مدیکر و کسر مدیکید - تعیین می‌شود. در اینجا، صورت کسر مدیکر تعداد روزهای بستری بیمار را که به بیماران مدیکر نسبت داده می‌شود، محاسبه می‌کند که «مستحق دریافت مزایا تحت [مدیکر] بخش A» و «مستحق دریافت مزایای درآمد تأمین تکمیلی ... تحت زیرفصل شانزدهم» بوده‌اند. 42 U. S. C. §1395ww(d)(5)(F)(vi)(I).
در پرونده‌ی بِسِرا علیه بنیاد سلامت امپایر، برای مرکز پزشکی بیمارستان ولی، ما معتقدیم که عبارت «مستحق دریافت مزایای [بخش الف مدیکر]» شامل «تمام افراد واجد شرایط این برنامه می‌شود، صرف نظر از اینکه آیا آنها برای بخشی یا تمام مدت بستری در بیمارستان، پرداخت‌های مدیکر را دریافت می‌کنند یا خیر.» 597 U. S. 424, 445 (2022) (به نقل از §1395ww(d)(5)(F)(vi)(I)؛ تغییر در متن اصلی). با این حال، ما تصمیم نگرفتیم که منظور از «مستحق دریافت مزایای درآمد امنیتی تکمیلی... تحت زیرفصل شانزدهم» چیست. §1395ww(d)(5)(F) (vi)(I). امروزه، ما معتقدیم که یک فرد زمانی واجد شرایط دریافت چنین مزایایی است که واجد شرایط دریافت پرداخت نقدی در طول ماه بستری خود باشد.


برنامه‌ی مدیکر، هزینه‌های بیمارستان‌هایی را که خدمات بستری را به ذینفعان مدیکر ارائه می‌دهند، بازپرداخت می‌کند. به بند ‎1395ww(d)‎ مراجعه کنید. به عنوان یک قاعده، «این برنامه بر اساس تشخیص بیمار، نرخ ثابتی را برای درمان هر بیمار مدیکر به بیمارستان پرداخت می‌کند» که «به گونه‌ای طراحی شده است که منعکس کننده مبالغی باشد که یک بیمارستان با مدیریت کارآمد، در همان منطقه، برای درمان بیماری با همان تشخیص هزینه می‌کند.» همان، صفحه 429 (با استناد به بندهای ‎1395ww(d)(1)–(4) و ‎42 CFR §412.2 (2022)). از آنجا که پرداخت با نرخ ثابت «صرف نظر از هزینه‌های واقعی بیمارستان» ارائه می‌شود، «به بیمارستان‌ها انگیزه می‌دهد تا سطوح کارآمدی از خدمات پزشکی را ارائه دهند.» Empire Health، 597 U. S.، صفحه 429.
کنگره همچنین «تنظیمات مختلف نرخ ویژه بیمارستان - از جمله موردی که در اینجا برای درمان بیماران کم‌درآمد مورد بحث است - را فراهم کرد.» همان. این تعدیل، تعدیل «سهم نامتناسب بیمارستان» (DSH) نامیده می‌شود که «بیمارستان‌هایی را که به «درصد غیرمعمول بالایی از بیماران کم‌درآمد» خدمت‌رسانی می‌کنند، افزایش پرداخت‌های مدیکر» فراهم می‌کند. همانجا (به نقل از Sebelius v. Auburn Regional Medical Center، 568 U. S. 145, 150 (2013)). این تعدیل این واقعیت را در نظر می‌گیرد که «درمان افراد کم‌درآمد اغلب گران‌تر از افراد با درآمد بالاتر است، حتی برای شرایط پزشکی یکسان». Empire Health، 597 U. S.، در صفحه 429. این افزایش پرداخت، بیمارستان‌ها را برای درمان بیماران کم‌درآمد ترغیب می‌کند. به همانجا مراجعه کنید. 
در Empire Health، تعدیل DSH را با جزئیات زیادی شرح دادیم، بنابراین در اینجا، مختصر خواهیم بود. برای محاسبه تعدیل DSH یک بیمارستان، وزارت بهداشت و خدمات انسانی (HHS) «دو کسر قانونی که معمولاً کسر مدیکر و کسر مدیکید نامیده می‌شوند» را با هم جمع می‌کند. همانجا؛ به بند ‎1395ww(d)(5)(F)(vi)‎ مراجعه کنید. این بخش‌ها روی هم رفته «برای پوشش دو جمعیت کم‌درآمد مختلف که یک بیمارستان به آنها خدمت‌رسانی می‌کند، طراحی شده‌اند.» همان، صفحه ۴۲۹. «بخش مدیکر، نشان‌دهنده نسبت بیماران مدیکر یک بیمارستان است که درآمد کمی دارند، همانطور که با حق دریافت مزایای درآمد تکمیلی (SSI) مشخص می‌شوند.» همان، صفحه ۴۲۹-۴۳۰. و «بخش مدیکید، نشان‌دهنده نسبت بیماران بیمارستان است که واجد شرایط مدیکر نیستند و درآمد کمی دارند،همانطور که توسط واجد شرایط بودن آنها برای Medicaid مشخص شده است." همان، صفحه ۴۳۰.
مانند Empire Health، این پرونده مربوط به کسر Medicare است که به صورت زیر تعریف می‌شود:

"کسری (به صورت درصد بیان می‌شود)، که صورت آن تعداد روزهای بستری در بیمارستان برای چنین دوره‌ای است که از بیمارانی تشکیل شده است که (برای چنین روزهایی) واجد شرایط دریافت مزایا تحت بخش A این زیرفصل بودند و واجد شرایط دریافت مزایای درآمد امنیتی تکمیلی (به استثنای هرگونه مکمل ایالتی) تحت زیرفصل شانزدهم این فصل بودند، و مخرج آن تعداد روزهای بستری در بیمارستان برای چنین سال مالی است که از بیمارانی تشکیل شده است که (برای چنین روزهایی) واجد شرایط دریافت مزایا تحت بخش A این زیرفصل بودند." §1395ww(d) (5)(F)(vi)(I).1
به زبان ساده‌تر، کسر Medicare به این صورت عمل می‌کند: صورت کسر «تعداد روزهای بستری شدن بیماران فقیر Medicare» را شمارش می‌کند - یعنی آن دسته از بیماران Medicare که طبق زیرفصل XVI واجد شرایط دریافت مزایای SSI هستند. همان، در ۴۳۰. مخرج کسر «تعداد روزهای بستری شدن بیماران فقیر Medicare» را شمارش می‌کند. همان. وقتی کسر مدیکر به صورت درصد بیان شده و به درصد کسر مدیکید اضافه می‌شود، حاصل جمع این دو، «درصد نامتناسب بیمار» می‌شود. §1395ww(d)(5)(F)(vi). درصد حاصل «تعیین می‌کند که آیا یک بیمارستان تعدیل DSH دریافت خواهد کرد یا خیر» - و اگر چنین است، چقدر. همان، در صفحه ۴۳۱. «هرچه درصد نامتناسب بیمار بالاتر باشد، بیمارستان بودجه بیشتری دریافت می‌کند.» همان، در صفحه ۴۳۲ (با استناد به §§1395ww(d)(5) (F)(vii)–(xiv)). 
برای اهداف این مورد، عبارت کلیدی در کسر مدیکر «حق دریافت مزایای درآمد امنیتی تکمیلی... تحت فصل فرعی شانزدهم» است. §1395ww(d)(5)(F)(vi)(I). درآمد تأمین اجتماعی تکمیلی «کمک‌هزینه معیشتی» است که به «نیازمندان سالمند، نابینا و معلول» کشور ارائه می‌شود. Schweiker v. Wilson, 450 U. S. 221, 223 (1981); همچنین به §1381 مراجعه کنید (که زیرفصل شانزدهم را به عنوان «برنامه ملی برای ارائه درآمد تأمین تکمیلی به افرادی که به سن 65 سالگی رسیده‌اند یا نابینا یا معلول هستند» توصیف می‌کند). HHS متن مربوطه را به گونه‌ای تفسیر می‌کند که به بیمارانی اشاره دارد که «در طول ماهی که در آن بستری شده‌اند، حق دریافت مزایای SSI را دارند». 75 Fed. Reg. 50281 (2010).2
دادخواهان، گروهی متشکل از بیش از 200 بیمارستان، با این تفسیر مخالفند. آنها اصرار دارند که این عبارت شامل تمام بیمارانی می‌شود که در زمان بستری شدن در سیستم SSI ثبت شده‌اند، حتی اگر آن بیماران در آن ماه واجد شرایط دریافت پرداخت SSI نبوده باشند. این رویکرد افراد بیشتری را به صورت کسر Medicare اضافه می‌کند و در نتیجه میزان بودجه‌ای را که یک بیمارستان ممکن است دریافت کند، افزایش می‌دهد. به §§1395ww(d)(5)(F)(vii)–(xiv). بیمارستان‌ها ادعا می‌کنند که به دلیل اینکه HHS کسر Medicare را اشتباه تفسیر کرده، در طول سال‌های مالی 2006 تا 2009 به آنها بودجه کافی نداده است.

بیمارستان‌ها در هر مرحله از این دعوی قضایی شکست خورده‌اند. هیئت بررسی بازپرداخت ارائه‌دهندگان، دادگاهی در HHS، درخواست بیمارستان‌ها برای بازپرداخت اضافی را به دلایل رویه‌ای رد کرد. مراکز خدمات Medicare و Medicaid، که Medicare را برای HHS اداره می‌کنند، نیز درخواست کمک را رد کردند، این بار به دلیل ماهیت. سپس بیمارستان‌ها درخواست بررسی در دادگاه منطقه‌ای را کردند که ادعاهای آنها را رد کرد و حکم اختصاری را به HHS اعطا کرد. برای گواهی 18 به Advocate Christ Medical Center v. Azar, No. 17–cv–1519 (D DC, June 8, 2022), App. to Pet. مراجعه کنید. دادگاه ناحیه D. C. نیز با HHS موافقت کرد. به Advocate Christ Medical Center مراجعه کنید. دادگاه تجدیدنظر ناحیه دی. سی. در توضیح اینکه مزایای SSI در «زیرفصل شانزدهم مربوط به پرداخت‌های نقدی برای افراد نیازمند است»، اظهار داشت که «بیان اینکه افراد در ماه‌هایی که حتی واجد شرایط [پرداخت] نیستند، «استحقاق» دریافت مزایا را دارند، منطقی نیست.» همان، صفحات 352-353. ما گواهی اعطا کردیم. 601 U. S. ___ (2024).
II
برای تعیین اینکه چه زمانی یک فرد «مستحق دریافت مزایای درآمد تأمین تکمیلی» است، طبق بندهای 1395ww(d)(5)(F)(vi)(I)، باید بدانیم که این مزایا چیست. به Empire Health، 597 U. S.، صفحات 435-439 مراجعه کنید. پاسخ واضح است: مزایای SSI مزایای نقدی هستند. به بند 42 U. S. C. فصل 7، بند فرعی XVI مراجعه کنید. بخش 1381a، که حق اساسی دریافت مزایا را شرح می‌دهد، مقرر می‌دارد که «[هر] فردی که بر اساس درآمد و منابع خود واجد شرایط تشخیص داده شود... باید توسط کمیسر مزایا دریافت کند.» (تأکید اضافه شده است.) کلمه «پرداخت شده» آشکارا به معنای مزایای نقدی است. بخش ۱۳۸۲(ب) نیز همین آهنگ را می‌نوازد: این بخش مبلغی را که سازمان تأمین اجتماعی ملزم به پرداخت به افراد واجد شرایط است، مشخص می‌کند و بیان می‌کند که «مزایای تحت این زیربخش... با نرخ [مبلغ دلاری خاص] قابل پرداخت خواهد بود.» §۱۳۸۲(ب)(۱). مزایایی که به صورت دلاری محاسبه می‌شوند، به وضوح مزایای نقدی هستند. با تأکید بر این نکته، سایر مقررات توضیح می‌دهند که چگونه و چه زمانی مزایای نقدی به دریافت‌کنندگان پرداخت می‌شود. به عنوان مثال، به §۱۳۸۳ (که رویه‌هایی را برای «پرداخت مزایا» تجویز می‌کند (موارد پررنگ حذف شده‌اند))؛ §۱۳۸۳(الف)(۴)(الف) (که «پیش‌پرداخت نقدی در برابر چنین مزایایی را مجاز می‌داند) مراجعه کنید.مزایایی» برای افراد در شرایط محدود).3 بیانیه مدون هدف زیرفصل شانزدهم از این قرار است: «ایجاد یک برنامه ملی برای ارائه درآمد تأمین تکمیلی به افرادی که به سن 65 سالگی رسیده‌اند یا نابینا یا معلول هستند.» §1381 (تأکید اضافه شده است). «درآمد» «سود یا مزایای مکرری است که معمولاً با پول و برای یک دوره زمانی معین اندازه‌گیری می‌شود.» 2 سومین فرهنگ لغت بین‌المللی جدید وبستر 1143 (1971).
مقررات قانونی خارج از زیرفصل شانزدهم نیز عبارت «مزایای [SSI] ...» را درک می‌کنند. «مطابق زیرفصل شانزدهم» به معنای مزایای نقدی است. بند ۱۳۲۰ب-۱۹ در زیرفصل یازدهم را در نظر بگیرید که به کمیسر تأمین اجتماعی دستور می‌دهد برنامه بلیط کار و خودکفایی را ایجاد کند. بخش ۱۳۲۰ب-۱۹ عبارت «مزایای درآمد تأمین تکمیلی» را به معنای «مزایای نقدی تحت بخش ۱۳۸۲ یا ۱۳۸۲هـ(الف) این عنوان» تعریف می‌کند. §1320b–19(k)(5)؛ همچنین به §1320a–6(b) مراجعه کنید (که اصطلاح «مزایای درآمد تکمیلی تأمین اجتماعی» را به «به معنای مزایای پرداخت شده یا قابل پرداخت توسط کمیسر تأمین اجتماعی تحت زیرفصل شانزدهم» تعریف می‌کند). همین امر در زیرفصل هشتم نیز صادق است که مزایای ویژه‌ای را برای برخی از جانبازان جنگ جهانی دوم فراهم می‌کند. در آنجا، کنگره «نرخ مزایای فدرال تحت زیرفصل شانزدهم» را به معنای «میزان سود نقدی درآمد تکمیلی تأمین اجتماعی در هر ماه» تعریف کرد. §1012(4). 
همانطور که زیرفصل شانزدهم روشن می‌کند که مزایای SSI مزایای نقدی هستند، همچنین تصریح می‌کند که واجد شرایط بودن برای چنین مزایایی به صورت ماهانه تعیین می‌شود. بخش 1382(c)(1) مقرر می‌کند که «واجد شرایط بودن فرد برای دریافت مزایا تحت این زیرفصل به مدت یک ماه» بر اساس «درآمد، منابع و سایر ویژگی‌های مرتبط فرد در آن ماه» تعیین می‌شود. اشاره قانون به قطع مزایا همچنین به ماه‌های عدم واجد شرایط بودن اشاره دارد: یک فرد باید پس از «عدم واجد شرایط بودن برای مزایا... برای یک دوره 12 ماهه متوالی» دوباره برای برنامه درخواست دهد. ‎§1383(j)(1)(B). مثال‌های دیگر نیز به همین ترتیب تأیید می‌کنند که واجد شرایط بودن، یک تحقیق ماهانه است. به عنوان مثال، به ‎§1382(e)(1)(A) مراجعه کنید (که بیان می‌کند «هیچ شخصی نباید در هر ماهی واجد شرایط باشد اگر در طول آن ماه زندانی یک موسسه عمومی باشد»)؛ ‎§1382(e)(1)(D) (که بیان می‌کند «[یک] شخص می‌تواند در هر ماهی که در طول آن ساکن یک پناهگاه اضطراری عمومی برای بی‌خانمان‌ها است، واجد شرایط باشد»)؛ ‎§§1382(e)(4)(A)(i)–(ii) (که بیان می‌کند «[هیچ] شخصی نباید در هر ماهی واجد شرایط در نظر گرفته شود اگر در طول آن ماه شخص... برای جلوگیری از پیگرد قانونی فرار کند» یا «شرط آزادی مشروط یا آزادی مشروط» را نقض کند). 
الف برای تکمیل مطلب، توجه داشته باشید: در حالی که زیرفصل شانزدهم در درجه اول در مورد واجد شرایط بودن برای مزایای SSI صحبت می‌کند، بخش مدیکر بر این موضوع تمرکز دارد که آیا فرد واجد شرایط دریافت چنین مزایایی است یا خیر. هیچ چیز به این تفاوت مربوط نمی‌شود. در Empire Health، ما کلمه "استحقاق" در قانون مدیکر (از جمله بخش مدیکر) را مترادف با "واجد شرایط بودن" یا "واجد شرایط بودن برای مزایا" در نظر گرفتیم. 597 U. S.، صفحه 435. همچنین به سومین فرهنگ لغت بین‌المللی جدید وبستر 758 ​​(1986) مراجعه کنید (که "entitle" را به عنوان "دادن حق یا عنوان قانونی به" یا "واجد شرایط (کسی) برای چیزی" تعریف می‌کند)؛ همان، صفحه 736 (که "eligible" را به عنوان "مناسب یا واجد شرایط برای انتخاب یا استفاده" یا "مستحق چیزی" تعریف می‌کند). این پرونده همچنین شامل بخش مدیکر می‌شود، بنابراین ما همین روند را دنبال می‌کنیم. به Brown v. Gardner، 513 U. S. 115, 118 (1994) مراجعه کنید (با اشاره به اینکه فرض استفاده مداوم "مطمئناً زمانی که یک اصطلاح در یک جمله مشخص تکرار می‌شود، در قوی‌ترین حالت خود قرار دارد"). بنابراین نتیجه می‌گیریم که یک فرد "مستحق مزایای [SSI] است... تحت زیرفصل شانزدهم» زمانی که او واجد شرایط دریافت پرداخت نقدی SSI است. و از آنجا که واجد شرایط بودن به صورت ماهانه تعیین می‌شود، یک فرد تنها در صورتی برای اهداف بخش مدیکر «مستحق دریافت مزایای [SSI]» در نظر گرفته می‌شود که در طول ماه بستری شدن در بیمارستان واجد شرایط دریافت چنین مزایایی باشد.

III
بیمارستان‌ها دو استدلال اصلی برای تفسیر عبارت «مستحق دریافت مزایای [SSI] ...» مطرح می‌کنند. تحت زیرفصل شانزدهم» به طور گسترده‌تر. اولاً، آنها مزایای SSI را شامل مزایای غیرنقدی می‌دانند که واجد شرایط بودن برای آنها به صورت ماهانه تعیین نمی‌شود. ثانیاً، بیمارستان‌ها، به همراه مخالفان، استدلال می‌کنند که واجد شرایط بودن برای مزایای SSI تا زمانی که فرد مجبور به درخواست مجدد برای آنها نشود، ادامه دارد، که این امر پس از 12 ماه متوالی عدم واجد شرایط بودن برای پرداخت نقدی رخ می‌دهد. به §1383(j)(1)(B) مراجعه کنید.

الف
از نظر بیمارستان‌ها، مزایای SSI شامل مزایای نقدی و غیرنقدی می‌شود - به طور خاص، خدمات توانبخشی حرفه‌ای و ادامه پوشش مدیکید.4 و بیمارستان‌ها ادعا می‌کنند که یک بیمار حتی در ماه‌هایی که پرداخت نقدی دریافت نمی‌کند، واجد شرایط این مزایا باقی می‌ماند.
نظریه بیمارستان‌ها از همان ابتدا اشتباه است، زیرا نه خدمات توانبخشی حرفه‌ای و نه ادامه پوشش مدیکید با این شرایط مطابقت ندارند.شرح مزایای «درآمد امنیتی تکمیلی». §1395ww(d)(5)(F)(vi)(I) (تأکید اضافه شده است). و حتی فراتر از این نکته بدیهی، هیچ یک از این مزایا «تحت عنوان زیرفصل شانزدهم» قرار نمی‌گیرد. همانجا (تأکید اضافه شده است). 
با اتکای بیمارستان‌ها به برنامه «بلیط کار و خودکفایی» شروع کنید. این برنامه که برای افراد واجد شرایط دریافت مزایای SSI بر اساس معلولیت یا نابینایی در دسترس است، از طریق سازمان‌های دولتی یا شبکه‌های اشتغال خصوصی، پشتیبانی توسعه شغلی و فرصت‌های شغلی گسترده را فراهم می‌کند. به §1320b-19 مراجعه کنید. از آنجا که زیرفصل یازدهم برنامه «بلیط کار» را ایجاد می‌کند، این یک مزیت «تحت عنوان زیرفصل شانزدهم» نیست. §1395ww(d)(5)(F)(vi)(I). 
هیچ یک از ارجاعات دیگر زیرفصل شانزدهم به خدمات توانبخشی حرفه‌ای، مزایای SSI را اعطا نمی‌کنند. برای مثال، بخش 1382d(a) از کمیسر می‌خواهد که افراد نابینا یا معلولی که ماهانه از SSI پول نقد دریافت می‌کنند را به «سازمان ایالتی مربوطه که برنامه ایالتی [a] را تحت عنوان فرعی V» از قانون تأمین اجتماعی اداره می‌کند، ارجاع دهد. بقیه بخش 1382d به SSA اجازه می‌دهد تا «به سازمان‌های ایالتی که خدمات توانبخشی حرفه‌ای مصوب تحت عنوان اول قانون توانبخشی 1973 را اداره یا نظارت می‌کنند، بازپرداخت» کند. بخش 1382d(d). این ارجاعات صریح به بخش فرعی V قانون تأمین اجتماعی و بخش اول قانون توانبخشی به مزایایی اشاره دارد که در جای دیگری - نه در بخش فرعی XVI - قرار دارند.


اتکای بیمارستان‌ها به پوشش مداوم مدیکید نیز بی‌فایده است. در اکثر ایالت‌ها، واجد شرایط بودن برای مزایای SSI، فرد را واجد شرایط پوشش درمانی مدیکید می‌کند. به بخش 1396a(a)(10)(A)(i)(II) مراجعه کنید. بنابراین، اگر شخصی درآمد اضافی کسب کند و واجد شرایط بودن خود را برای پرداخت‌های SSI از دست بدهد، عموماً دسترسی به Medicaid را نیز از دست می‌دهد. به همانجا مراجعه کنید؛ Baystate Medical Center v. Leavitt, 545 F. Supp. 2d 20, 37, n. 24 (DC 2008). بخش 1382h(b) یک استثنای محدود برای آن قانون پیش‌فرض ایجاد می‌کند. این بخش مقرر می‌دارد که «برای اهداف زیرفصل نوزدهم [مربوط به Medicaid]، هر فردی که به عنوان یک فرد نابینا یا معلول واجد شرایط دریافت مزایای [SSI] طبق بخش 1382 تعیین شده باشد» و «که در یک ماه بعد به دلیل «درآمد» اضافی واجد شرایط دریافت مزایا تحت این زیرفصل نباشد»، همچنان «دریافت‌کننده مزایای [SSI] در نظر گرفته می‌شود.» §1382h(b). طبق گفته بیمارستان‌ها، مزیت ادامه پوشش Medicaid «منحصراً از بخش 1382h(b) ناشی می‌شود» و بنابراین به عنوان یک مزیت SSI محسوب می‌شود. خلاصه برای درخواست‌کنندگان ۳۷.
بیمارستان‌ها اشتباه می‌کنند. بخش ۱۳۸۲h(b) مزایای درآمد امنیتی تکمیلی ایجاد نمی‌کند - بلکه به مدیریت برنامه مدیکید کمک می‌کند. (از این رو، عبارت آغازین بخش ۱۳۸۲h(b) بیان می‌کند که این ماده «برای اهداف زیرفصل نوزدهم» است که مدیکید را اداره می‌کند.) این ماده صرفاً به افراد نابینا یا معلول خاصی که واجد شرایط دریافت مزایای SSI در یک ماه معین نیستند، اجازه می‌دهد تا طوری رفتار شود که گویی واجد شرایط مزایای SSI هستند تا بتوانند به دریافت مزایای مدیکید ادامه دهند. اگر ادامه پوشش مدیکید یک مزیت SSI تحت زیرفصل شانزدهم باشد، این یک روش بسیار عجیب برای اثبات آن است. طبق نظریه بیمارستان‌ها، این ماده به افرادی که همزمان «فاقد شرایط دریافت مزایای [SSI]» توصیف می‌شوند، مزیت SSI اعطا می‌کند. بخش ۱۳۸۲h(b). این خلاف عقل سلیم است. ب
بیمارستان‌ها، به همراه مخالفان، استدلال دومی را مطرح می‌کنند: واجد شرایط بودن، حتی برای مزایای صرفاً نقدی، از زمانی شروع می‌شود که فرد وارد سیستم SSI می‌شود و تا زمانی که به مدت ۱۲ ماه متوالی واجد شرایط نباشد، ادامه می‌یابد، که در آن زمان باید درخواست جدیدی برای مزایا ارائه دهد. به پست، در ۷، ۱۱-۱۳ (نظر جکسون، جی) مراجعه کنید. 
برای حمایت از این نظریه، بیمارستان‌ها و مخالفان تأکید می‌کنند که وقتی فردی برای اولین بار برای مزایا درخواست می‌دهد، باید «نرخ» درآمد خود را «برای سال تقویمی» افشا کند. §1382(a)(1)(A)؛ به پست، در ۱۱ مراجعه کنید. کاملاً درست است. اما درآمد «سال تقویمی» او او را واجد شرایط دریافت مزایای SSI نمی‌کند، و همچنین ثابت نمی‌کند که مزایای SSI در فواصل زمانی با مدت بیش از یک ماه اعمال می‌شود. برای این منظور، او همچنان باید نشان دهد که الزامات یک ماه معین را برآورده می‌کند. در واقع، یکی از مفاد قانون، تعیین واجد شرایط بودن را «به مدت یک ماه» «بر اساس درآمد، منابع و سایر ویژگی‌های مرتبط فرد در آن ماه» هدایت می‌کند. §1382(c) (تأکید اضافه شده است). و در حالی که مخالف به دنبال کمک به §1383(a)(2)(B)(viii) است، هیچ کمکی ارائه نمی‌شود. اینکه کمیسر می‌تواند «پرداخت مزایا را (در صورت استحقاق اولیه) به تعویق بیندازد یا (در صورت استحقاق موجود) به حالت تعلیق درآورد»، §1383(a)(2)(B)(viii)، صرفاً به مسئله زمان‌بندی می‌پردازد - همانطور که مخالف می‌گوید، «رابطه بلندمدت مزایا را در نظر نمی‌گیرد»، پست، در ساعت 12.
همچنین الزام درخواست مجدد، ماهیت واجد شرایط بودن را تغییر نمی‌دهد. طبق ماده §1383(j)(1)(B)، فردی که قبلاً واجد شرایط بوده است، باید پس از اینکه «به مدت ۱۲ ماه متوالی واجد شرایط دریافت مزایا نبوده است»، درخواست جدیدی ارائه دهد. توجه داشته باشید که این ماده نمی‌گوید که یک فردتا پایان این دوره ۱۲ ماهه واجد شرایط باقی می‌ماند. برعکس: بیان می‌کند که شخصی که در یک مقطع «فردی واجد شرایط» بوده است، باید پس از ۱۲ ماه متوالی عدم واجد شرایط بودن، دوباره درخواست دهد. §1383(j)(1)(A) (تأکید اضافه شده است). همانطور که دادگاه حوزه انتخابیه دی. سی. اظهار داشت، «معنی ندارد که بگوییم افراد در ماه‌هایی که حتی واجد شرایط دریافت مزایا نیستند، «مستحق» دریافت آنها هستند.» 80 F. 4th، در صفحه 353.5
با تکیه بر Empire Health، که به بخش A مدیکر پرداخته است، بیمارستان‌ها و مخالفان ما را ترغیب می‌کنند که مزایای SSI را به عنوان یک «برنامه بیمه درآمد» در نظر بگیریم. خلاصه برای دادخواست‌دهندگان ۴۱؛ به پست، در صفحات ۱۶-۱۷ مراجعه کنید. این کفش مناسب نیست. برنامه‌های بیمه عموماً «حمایت اولیه‌ای را در برابر [هزینه‌های خاص آینده] ارائه می‌دهند»، از جمله، در مورد بخش A مدیکر، «هزینه‌های بیمارستان، خدمات پس از بیمارستان، خدمات درمانی در منزل و مراقبت‌های آسایشگاهی». §1395c (که بخش A مدیکر را به عنوان یک «برنامه بیمه» توصیف می‌کند). در مقابل، مزایای SSI پشتوانه‌ای مداوم در برابر هزینه‌های غیرمنتظره ارائه نمی‌دهند - آنها به عنوان یک پرداخت رفاهی عمل می‌کنند که مستقیماً به درآمد دریافت‌کنندگان یارانه می‌دهد. به Schweiker، 450 U. S.، در 223 مراجعه کنید (که SSI را به عنوان «ارائه کمک هزینه معیشت» توصیف می‌کند)؛ Bowen v. Galbreath، 485 U. S. 74, 75 (1988) (که SSI را به عنوان «برنامه رفاهی» توصیف می‌کند).


علیرغم این اختلافات، بیمارستان‌ها و مخالفان اصرار دارند که سازگاری با Empire Health ما را ملزم به رد تفسیر HHS می‌کند. به خلاصه درخواست‌کنندگان ۱۹-۲۱ مراجعه کنید؛ پست، در صفحات ۱۴-۱۷. به یاد داشته باشید که در Empire Health، ما عبارت «مستحق دریافت مزایای [بخش A مدیکر]» را به معنای «تمام افراد واجد شرایط برای این برنامه، صرف نظر از اینکه آیا آنها برای بخشی یا تمام مدت بستری در بیمارستان، پرداخت‌های مدیکر دریافت می‌کنند» تفسیر کردیم. 597 U. S.، در صفحه ۴۴۵ (به نقل از §1395ww(d)(5)(F)(vi)(I)؛ تغییر در متن اصلی). بنابراین در اینجا نیز، بیمارستان‌ها و مخالفان ادعا می‌کنند: «مستحق دریافت مزایای [SSI] بودن» به این معنی است که یک بیمار حتی اگر در طول ماه بستری واجد شرایط دریافت پرداخت نباشد، واجد شرایط دریافت مزایای SSI است.6
با این حال، Empire Health به جای حمایت از این تفسیر، با آن مخالفت می‌کند. ما پس از بررسی دقیق پیش‌نیازها و ویژگی‌های آن مزیت خاص، حق دریافت مزایا را تحت بخش A مدیکر تعریف کردیم. به همان، در صفحات ۴۳۵-۴۳۹ مراجعه کنید. ما مشاهده کردیم که بخش A بیمه درمانی مدیکر، بیمه سلامت خودکار و مداوم را برای افراد بالای ۶۵ سال یا دارای معلولیت مزمن ارائه می‌دهد. همان، صفحات ۴۳۵-۴۳۶. و توضیح دادیم که حق بیمه بخش A مدیکر «هرگز از بین نمی‌رود» مگر اینکه «معلولیت» مزمن فرد ذینفع کاهش یابد، و «نمی‌توان تصور کرد که توقف پرداخت برای هر خدمتی، بر حق قانونی گسترده‌تر برای مزایای بخش A تأثیر بگذارد.» همان، صفحه ۴۳۷. به عنوان مثال، حتی اگر بیماری «به محدودیت پوشش» برای مراقبت از چشم تحت بخش A برسد، «بیمه‌نامه [در دوره پوشش بعدی] هزینه مراقبت از چشم بیشتری را پرداخت می‌کند و در عین حال هزینه [تعویض] زانو را نیز پرداخت خواهد کرد.» همان. 
همانطور که تصمیم ما در پرونده امپایر هلث به ویژگی‌های خاص بخش A مدیکر پرداخت، این پرونده نیز به ویژگی‌های خاص مزایای SSI تحت زیرفصل شانزدهم می‌پردازد. و مقایسه این دو برنامه، تمایزات مهمی را آشکار می‌کند. باز هم، در حالی که مزایای بخش A مدیکر فراتر از پرداخت‌های خاص برای هر نیاز پزشکی خاص است، مزایای SSI تحت زیرفصل شانزدهم شامل پرداخت‌های نقدی ماهانه و نه چیز دیگری است. و در حالی که حق دریافت مزایای بخش A مدیکر خودکار و مداوم است (به استثنای معلولیتی که کاهش می‌یابد)، مزایای SSI هیچ‌کدام از این دو نیست: دریافت‌کنندگان باید برای مزایا درخواست دهند و واجد شرایط دریافت آن شناخته شوند، و دریافت‌کنندگان می‌توانند (و می‌شوند) بسته به درآمد و منابع خود از یک ماه به ماه دیگر واجد شرایط بودن خود را تغییر دهند و از آن خارج شوند. بنابراین، مطابق با تحلیل متمرکز بر مزایا توسط Empire Health، ما را ملزم می‌کند که تفاوت‌های بین مزایای بخش A مدیکر و مزایای SSI را تشخیص داده و به آنها جامه عمل بپوشانیم.

C
در نهایت، با استناد به هدف قانونی، بیمارستان‌ها و مخالفان اصرار دارند که تفسیر آنها از «مستحق دریافت مزایای [SSI] ... تحت زیرفصل شانزدهم» به بهترین وجه با «هدف نهایی کنگره [از] ارائه [به] بیمارستان‌هایی که به نیازمندترین افراد در میان ما با سطح مناسب بودجه حیاتی خدمت می‌کنند» مطابقت دارد. پست، در صفحه ۲. (در واقع، مخالفان استدلال خود را در درجه اول در مورد هدف قانون و فقط در درجه دوم در مورد متن آن مطرح می‌کنند.) آنها برداشت ما را با هدف کلی کسر Medicare و تعدیل DSH مغایر می‌دانند، زیرا افرادی که اتفاقاً در یک ماه معین واجد شرایط دریافت پرداخت نقدی SSI نیستند، بعید است که از یک ماه به ماه دیگر سالم‌تر یا کم‌هزینه‌تر باشند. از نظر آنها، گنجاندن این بیماران در صورت کسر Medicare، بار بیمارستان را بهتر اندازه‌گیری می‌کند و تضمین می‌کند که بیمارستان "سطح مناسبی از بودجه حیاتی" را دریافت می‌کند. همان.

این استدلال نادیده می‌گیرد که کنگره وسیله خاصی را برای پیشبرد هدف خود مبنی بر تأمین مالی بهتر بیمارستان‌هایی که از درصد نامتناسبی از بیماران نیازمند Medicare مراقبت می‌کنند، انتخاب کرده است. می‌توانست وسیله دیگری را انتخاب کند. به عنوان مثال،ld تعداد بیماران فقیر مدیکر را با تکیه بر اثبات درآمد سالانه ثبت کرده است. (این اقدام ممکن است صورت کسر و بنابراین نرخ بازپرداخت را افزایش دهد.) از طرف دیگر، می‌توانست بیماران مدیکر که درمانشان گران است را با استفاده از نه تنها درآمد سالانه آنها، بلکه سابقه سلامت آنها نیز به طور دقیق‌تری جدا کند. (این اقدام ممکن است صورت کسر و بنابراین نرخ بازپرداخت را کاهش دهد.) اما به جای انتخاب یکی از این گزینه‌ها (یا برخی گزینه‌های دیگر)، کنگره تصمیم گرفت سهم بیمارستان از بیماران مدیکر که درمانشان گران است را با استفاده از حق بیمار برای دریافت مزایای SSI تحت زیرفصل شانزدهم تخمین بزند. این یک معیار کامل برای درآمد نیست - اما درآمد نیز معیار کاملی برای این نیست که آیا درمان یک بیمار پرهزینه‌تر است یا خیر. در نهایت، کسر مدیکر و تعدیل نهایی DSH نشان دهنده تعادل منافع رقابتی متعدد، از جمله افزایش بودجه برای بیمارستان‌ها، قابلیت مدیریت، کارایی و تخصیص منابع محدود است. بنابراین، بله، کنگره به دنبال افزایش نرخ بازپرداخت برای بیمارستان‌هایی بود که از سهم نامتناسبی از بیماران کم‌درآمد مدیکر مراقبت می‌کنند. اما همانطور که قبلاً بارها توضیح داده‌ایم، «هیچ قانونی یک سیاست واحد را به هر قیمتی دنبال نمی‌کند و ما آزاد نیستیم که این قانون (یا هر قانون دیگری) را طوری بازنویسی کنیم که انگار واقعاً چنین بوده است.» بارتن‌ورفر علیه باکلی، 598 U. S. 69, 81 (2023)؛ لونا پرز علیه مدارس دولتی استورگیس، 598 U. S. 142, 150 (2023) («هیچ قانونی «هدف... خود را به هر قیمتی دنبال نمی‌کند»» (تغییرات در متن اصلی))؛ شرکت امریکن اکسپرس علیه رستوران ایتالیایی کالرز، 570 U. S. 228, 234 (2013) (همان)؛ کوکانا علیه هولدر، 558 U. S. 233, 252 (2010) (همان)؛ رودریگز علیه ایالات متحده، 480 U. S. 522, 525–526 (1987) (به ازای هر کوریام) (همان). ما باید مشخص کنیم که کنگره چگونه هدف خود را دنبال کرده است. هنسون علیه سانتاندر کانسومر یو اس ای اینک.، 582 U. S. 79, 89 (2017) («قانون‌گذاری، در نهایت، هنر مصالحه است، محدودیت‌های بیان‌شده در قالب قوانین اغلب بهای تصویب آن هستند»). و در اینجا، کنگره انتخاب خاصی انجام داد: برای اهداف بخش مدیکر، فردی «مستحق دریافت مزایای [SSI]» است که واجد شرایط دریافت پرداخت نقدی SSI در طول ماه بستری شدن در بیمارستان باشد. §1395ww(d)(5)(F)(vi)(I). ما باید به فرمولی که کنگره تجویز کرده است احترام بگذاریم. *  *  *
به دلایل فوق، حکم دادگاه تجدیدنظر را تأیید می‌کنیم.

این حکم به این شرح صادر شده است.

یادداشت‌ها
1 اگرچه بخش مدیکر عبارت «درآمد تأمین تکمیلی» را به کار می‌برد، §1395ww(d)(5)(F)(vi)(I) (تأکید اضافه شده است)، زیرفصل شانزدهم به این مزیت به عنوان «درآمد تأمین تکمیلی» اشاره می‌کند، §1381 (تأکید اضافه شده است). با وجود تفاوت جزئی در عبارت‌بندی، این دو عبارت به یک مزیت اشاره دارند.

2 برای محاسبه تعداد افراد واجد شرایط دریافت مزایای SSI در یک ماه خاص، HHS داده‌هایی را از اداره تأمین اجتماعی (SSA) دریافت می‌کند که به دنبال «جمع‌آوری تمام افراد دارای حق SSI در طول ماه(هایی) است که حق دریافت مزایای SSI را دارند». 75 Fed. Reg. 50281. اداره خدمات اجتماعی این داده‌ها را با شناسایی «کدهای وضعیت» خاصی جمع‌آوری می‌کند که نشان می‌دهد آیا یک فرد در طول یک ماه خاص واجد شرایط دریافت مزایای SSI بوده است یا خیر. همان. به عنوان بخشی از قانون‌گذاری در سال 2010، HHS کدهای مختلف مورد استفاده SSA را ارزیابی کرد و به این نتیجه رسید که سه کد (C01، M01 و M02) جمعیت مربوط به افراد واجد شرایط دریافت مزایای نقدی ماهانه SSI را در بر می‌گیرد. همان. کد C01 نشان دهنده ثبت‌نام‌کنندگان SSI است که پرداخت نقدی خودکار دریافت می‌کنند و کدهای M01 و M02 نشان دهنده ثبت‌نام‌کنندگان SSI است که پرداخت‌های نقدی آنها به صورت دستی مدیریت می‌شود. به Advocate Christ Medical Center v. Becerra, 80 F. 4th 346, 350, n. 1 (CADC 2023) مراجعه کنید. به عنوان بخشی از آن قانون‌گذاری، HHS پیشنهادی برای شروع استفاده از کدهای SSA اضافی را رد کرد که به گفته نظردهنده، «نمایانگر افرادی هستند که واجد شرایط SSI هستند، اما واجد شرایط دریافت پرداخت‌های SSI نیستند» در یک ماه معین، از جمله به این دلیل که فرد در وضعیت «معلق» قرار دارد. 75 فدرال. Reg. 50280–50281؛ به 20 CFR §§416.1320–416.1330, 416.1339 (2024) مراجعه کنید (که تعلیق پرداخت مزایا را شرح می‌دهد). HHS در رد این پیشنهاد توضیح داد که «هیچ یک از کدهای وضعیت SSI ... ذکر شده برای توصیف فردی که در طول ماهی که یکی از آن کدهای وضعیت استفاده شده، واجد شرایط دریافت مزایای SSI بوده است، استفاده نمی‌شود.» 75 فدرال. Reg. 50281. این پرونده این سوال را مطرح نمی‌کند که آیا HHS به درستی فقط سه کد وضعیت SSI را به عنوان بخشی از محاسبه خود برای کسر Medicare در نظر می‌گیرد یا خیر. در زیر، دادگاه تجدیدنظر حوزه انتخابیه D. C. از بررسی این موضوع که آیا HHS «به طور غیرمنطقی افرادی را که کدهای «S» و «E02» به آنها اختصاص داده شده است از کسر Medicare حذف کرده است» خودداری کرد، زیرا بیمارستان‌ها برای اولین بار این استدلال را در خلاصه پاسخ خود مطرح کردند. 80 F. 4th، در صفحه 354. ما نیز از بررسی این موضوع خودداری می‌کنیم.

3 همچنین به بند 1382(h) (که قوانین مربوط به «تعیین واجد شرایط بودن و میزان مزایای قابل پرداخت» به افرادی که انواع دیگر کمک مالی را دریافت می‌کنند را شرح می‌دهد)؛ بند 1382f(a) (که «افزایش مبالغ دلاری» مزایای SSI را بر اساس ... ارائه می‌دهد) مراجعه کنید.تعدیلات مربوط به پایان عمر (با حروف پررنگ حذف شده))؛ §1383(b)(1)(A) (ارائه «تعدیلات مناسب در پرداخت‌های آینده» در صورت پرداخت بیش از حد یا کمتر از حد مزایای SSI).

4 در دادگاه زیر، بیمارستان‌ها یارانه داروهای تجویزی بخش D مدیکر را به عنوان یکی دیگر از مزایای غیرنقدی SSI مطرح کردند. از آنجا که بیمارستان‌ها اتکای خود را به آن برنامه قطع کرده‌اند، ما به آن نمی‌پردازیم.

5 علاوه بر این، به نظر می‌رسد این ماده یک اقدام نظارتی است: تقریباً 14 سال پس از برقراری مزایای SSI اضافه شده است و روند درخواست مجدد را به رویه دیرینه SSA در حذف افراد از پایگاه داده خود پس از 12 ماه عدم صلاحیت مرتبط می‌کند. به 101 Stat. 3576؛ Tr. of Oral Arg. 60 مراجعه کنید. سایر مفاد نظارتی نیز نشان نمی‌دهند که واجد شرایط بودن برای مزایای SSI به چیزی غیر از ماهانه تعیین می‌شود. برای مثال، به بند ‎1383(e)(1)(B)(ii)(II)(bb)‎ مراجعه کنید (که دسترسی سازمان تأمین اجتماعی به اطلاعات مالی دریافت‌کننده مزایا را تا زمان «قطع صلاحیت دریافت‌کننده برای مزایا تحت این زیرفصل» تضمین می‌کند)؛ بند ‎1382c(a)(3) (H)(ii)(I)‎ (که سازمان تأمین اجتماعی را ملزم می‌کند حداقل «هر 3 سال یک بار» «ادامه واجد شرایط بودن برای مزایا تحت این زیرفصل برای هر فردی که به سن 18 سالگی نرسیده و به دلیل نقصی که احتمالاً بهبود می‌یابد، واجد شرایط دریافت چنین مزایایی است» را بررسی کند).

6 رأی مخالف همچنین قرائت ما از قانون را به این دلیل که برخی از بیماران را که به دلایلی غیرمرتبط با درآمد، در طول ماه بستری خود در بیمارستان، موفق به دریافت وجه نمی‌شوند، از صورت کسر بخش مدیکر مستثنی می‌کند، مورد انتقاد قرار می‌دهد. به پست، در شماره ۹ مراجعه کنید. اما تصمیم کنگره برای حذف افراد خاص از واجد شرایط بودن برای مزایای SSI تحت زیرفصل شانزدهم نشان می‌دهد که «برنامه SSI دامنه وسیعی دارد، [اما] پوشش آن کامل نیست.» Schweiker v. Wilson, 450 U. S. 221, 224 (1981). و باز هم، ما هیچ موضعی در مورد اینکه آیا HHS به طور غیرمنطقی کدهای خاصی را از بخش Medicare حذف کرده است یا خیر، اتخاذ نمی‌کنیم.

قاضی جکسون، که قاضی سوتومایور به او می‌پیوندد، در حال مخالفت. 
ارائه خدمات درمانی با کیفیت به بیماران کم‌درآمد می‌تواند پرهزینه باشد. وقتی کنگره سیستم بازپرداخت هزینه‌های بیمارستانی مدیکر را تأسیس کرد، تشخیص داد که افراد کم‌درآمد معمولاً شرایط سلامتی و پیامدهای سلامتی نسبتاً بدتری نسبت به افراد ثروتمند دارند و با دیدی روشن به این واقعیت نگاه می‌کرد که در نتیجه، «بیمارستان‌هایی که به سهم نامتناسبی از بیماران کم‌درآمد خدمات ارائه می‌دهند، هزینه‌های مراقبت‌های بهداشتی بالاتری دارند.» H. R. Rep. No. 99–241, p. 16 (1985). برای در نظر گرفتن هزینه‌های متغیر مربوط به نیازهای مراقبت‌های بهداشتی جمعیت‌های مختلف اجتماعی-اقتصادی، کنگره تصمیم گرفت بیمارستان‌هایی را که «سهم نامتناسبی» از بیماران کم‌درآمد دارند، با نرخی متفاوت (بیشتر) از سایر بیمارستان‌ها بازپرداخت کند.

این پرونده مربوط به فرمولی است که کنگره برای شناسایی و جبران خسارت آن بیمارستان‌ها استفاده می‌کند. اکثریت و من در مورد جنبه‌های کلیدی ماده قانونی مورد بحث، توافق قابل توجهی داریم. ما موافقیم که هدف فرمول «سهم نامتناسب» مدیکر، شناسایی بیمارستان‌هایی است که به تعداد نامتناسبی از بیماران کم‌درآمد خدمات ارائه می‌دهند. ما موافقیم که این فرمول به برنامه درآمد تأمینی تکمیلی (SSI) - یک برنامه مزایایی برای آمریکایی‌های کم‌درآمد که افراد خاصی را واجد شرایط دریافت پرداخت‌های نقدی از دولت می‌کند - توجه دارد و تعداد بیماران واجد شرایط مدیکر بیمارستان را که "مستحق" دریافت SSI نیز هستند، محاسبه می‌کند. ما موافقیم که طبق برنامه SSI، واجد شرایط بودن برای دریافت پرداخت نقدی در یک ماه معین به درآمد ماهانه فرد بستگی دارد. و ما موافقیم که اگر برنامه SSI مانند بخش A مدیکر عمل کند، تصمیم ما در پرونده Becerra v. Empire Health Foundation، برای مرکز پزشکی بیمارستان ولی، 597 U. S. 424 (2022)، نتیجه این پرونده را کنترل می‌کند و ما را ملزم به صدور حکم به نفع بیمارستان‌ها می‌کند. 
با توجه به آنچه گفته شد، تفسیر اکثریت از فرمول سهم نامتناسب مدیکر مبتنی بر یک سوءتفاهم اساسی در مورد نحوه عملکرد برنامه مزایای نقدی SSI است. و این سوءتفاهم باعث شده است که اکثریت، قانون مدیکر را بدون توجه به عملکرد ارجاع فرمول به برنامه SSI ارزیابی کنند و به نتیجه نادرستی برسند. 
به طور خاص: وقتی کنگره فرمول سهم نامتناسب مدیکر را ایجاد کرد، به دلیلی به برنامه مزایای نقدی SSI نگاه کرد. هیچ کس منکر این نیست که هدف نهایی کنگره، تأمین سطح مناسبی از بودجه حیاتی برای بیمارستان‌هایی بود که به نیازمندترین افراد در میان ما خدمت می‌کنند. بنابراین، تنها مبنای منطقی برای اتکای فرمول به SSI، استخراج از روابط عمومی آن برنامه است.مجموعه الکترونیکی افرادی که قبلاً به عنوان نیازمندترین افراد جامعه ما تعیین شده‌اند - نه برای ارزیابی این واقعیت کاملاً بی‌ربط که آیا چنین فردی واقعاً در طول ماه بستری شدن خود تحت برنامه SSI پرداخت نقدی دریافت کرده است یا خیر. تفسیر اکثریت هم این زمینه مهم را نادیده می‌گیرد و هم تفسیری از فرمول مدیکر را تأیید می‌کند که به طور خودسرانه بیماران کم‌درآمد بیمارستان را کمتر از حد واقعی محاسبه می‌کند. 
به طور خلاصه، طبق برداشت اکثریت، اشاره کنگره به طرح SSI در قانون مدیکر هیچ هدف منطقی ندارد. بدتر از آن، به نظر می‌رسد اکثریت فکر می‌کنند که یک فرمول قانونی که به طور خاص برای مجاز کردن پرداخت‌ها به بیمارستان‌های خاص در مبالغ بیشتر طراحی شده است، بهتر است برای تأثیرگذاری بر رد خودسرانه آن وجوه اضافی تفسیر شود. با احترام، من مخالفم.

"برنامه مدیکر بیمه درمانی با بودجه دولتی را برای بیش از 64 میلیون آمریکایی مسن یا معلول فراهم می‌کند." Empire Health، 597 U. S.، صفحه 428. این برنامه عموماً با بازپرداخت هزینه‌های درمان بیماران تحت پوشش مدیکر به بیمارستان‌ها عمل می‌کند. به 42 U. S. C. §1395ww(d) مراجعه کنید. برای تشویق بیمارستان‌ها به درمان بیماران به کارآمدترین روش، کنگره هزینه‌های خدماتی را که بیمارستان‌ها ارائه می‌دهند با نرخ ثابتی که به تشخیص بیمار بستگی دارد تا هزینه‌های واقعی بیمارستان، بازپرداخت می‌کند. Empire Health، 597 U. S.، صفحه 429.
اما کنگره همچنین تشخیص داد که برخی از بیمارستان‌ها شرایط سخت‌تری نسبت به سایرین دارند. بر اساس تحقیقات تجربی، به طور خاص مشاهده کرد که «بیمارستان‌هایی که به سهم نامتناسبی از بیماران کم‌درآمد خدمات ارائه می‌دهند، هزینه‌های مدیکر بالاتری دارند» و این به دو دلیل اصلی است. H. R. Rep. شماره 99-241، صفحه 16؛ همچنین به Empire Health، 597 U. S.، صفحه 429 مراجعه کنید. اولاً، بیماران کم‌درآمد معمولاً از ابتدا سلامت ضعیف‌تری دارند و پس از اقدامات پزشکی عوارض بیشتری نسبت به بیمارانی که ثروتمندتر هستند، دارند. H. R. Rep. شماره 99-241، صفحه 16. ثانیاً، بیمارستان‌هایی که تعداد قابل توجهی از بیماران کم‌درآمد را می‌بینند، اغلب باید پرسنل اضافی، مانند مددکاران اجتماعی و مترجمان، را برای خدمت به این جمعیت استخدام کنند که به هزینه‌های ثابت بیمارستان می‌افزاید. همان. 
بنابراین کنگره به طور منطقی تصمیم گرفت که بیمارستان‌هایی که سهم نامتناسبی از بیماران کم‌درآمد دارند، باید بازپرداخت‌های مدیکر بیشتری دریافت کنند. Empire Health، 597 U. S.، صفحه 429. و به ویژه، با جبران نابرابری در هزینه‌های درمان، کنگره امیدوار بود که «بیمارستان‌ها را به درمان بیماران کم‌درآمد تشویق کند.» همان.
برای دستیابی به اهداف بازپرداخت عادلانه کنگره، ابتدا باید بیمارستان‌هایی که سهم نامتناسبی از بیماران کم‌درآمد دارند، شناسایی می‌شدند. یک گزینه این بود که از همه بیمارستان‌ها خواسته شود درآمد بیماران خود را پیگیری کرده و آنها را به دولت گزارش دهند. H. R. Rep. شماره 99-241، صفحه 17. اما این کار بار اداری را به بیمارستان‌های از قبل پربار اضافه می‌کرد. همان. بنابراین، در عوض، کنگره فرمولی ابداع کرد که می‌توانست برای محاسبه درصد بیماران کم‌درآمد یک بیمارستان با استفاده از داده‌های اداری موجود در اختیار دولت استفاده شود. به §1395ww(d)(5)(F)(vi) مراجعه کنید. 
همانطور که اکثریت به طور مفید توضیح می‌دهند، بخشی از آن فرمول - که در اینجا به عنوان "بخش مدیکر" نامیده می‌شود - درصد بیماران واجد شرایط مدیکر یک بیمارستان را که درآمد کمی دارند، محاسبه می‌کند. پایه آن بخش، تعداد کل روزهایی است که بیماران مدیکر در بیمارستان گذرانده‌اند. قبل، در ۴. صورت کسر تعداد روزهایی را که «به بیماران مدیکر که فقیر هستند» نسبت داده می‌شود، همانطور که توسط حق آنها برای دریافت مزایای SSI تعیین می‌شود، محاسبه می‌کند. همان. 
ما این پرونده را برای تصمیم‌گیری در مورد اینکه چه کسی در صورت کسر قرار می‌گیرد، در نظر گرفتیم. یعنی، کدام بیماران بیمارستانی «مستحق دریافت مزایای [SSI]» برای اهداف فرمول سهم نامتناسب هستند؟ §1395ww(d)(5)(F)(vi)(I). این یک سوال فنی و محدود به نظر می‌رسد. اما ریسک پاسخ برای بیمارستان‌ها بسیار بالاست، زیرا هرچه تعداد بیماران بیمارستانی که در صورت کسر قرار می‌گیرند بیشتر باشد، آن بیمارستان پول بازپرداخت مدیکر بیشتری دریافت خواهد کرد.

II
اکثریت از جای درست شروع می‌کنند. «برای تعیین اینکه چه زمانی یک فرد «مستحق دریافت مزایای درآمد تأمین تکمیلی» است، «باید بدانیم مزایا چیست.» قبل، در صفحه ۶ (به نقل از §1395ww(d)(5)(F)(vi)(I)). اما به سرعت اشتباه می‌کند. به گفته اکثریت، از آنجا که SSI افراد را واجد شرایط دریافت «مزایای نقدی» می‌کند و واجد شرایط بودن برای این مزایا «به صورت ماهانه تعیین می‌شود»، قبل، در صفحه ۷، بخش مدیکر فقط بیمارانی را که واجد شرایط دریافت پرداخت نقدی تحت SSI در طول ماه بستری شدن در بیمارستان هستند، شمارش می‌کند. این نتیجه‌گیری هم مزایایی را که SSI ارائه می‌دهد و هم مهمتر از آن، دلیل استفاده کنگره از SSI به عنوان نماینده خود برای شناسایی بیماران کم‌درآمد را اشتباه درک می‌کند.

الف
مقررات همراه با قانون SSI بیان می‌کند که «هدف اصلی برنامه [SSI] تضمین حداقل سطح درآمد برای افرادی است که ۶۵ سال یا بیشتر دارند، یا نابینا یا معلول هستند و درآمد و منابع کافی برای ... ندارند.»«سطح زندگی خود را در سطح حداقل درآمد فدرال تعیین‌شده حفظ کنید.» 20 CFR §416.110 (2024). ما همچنین در جای دیگری توضیح داده‌ایم که «برنامه SSI حداقل درآمد تضمین‌شده فدرال را برای سالمندان، نابینایان و معلولان تعیین می‌کند.» Schweiker v. Hogan, 457 U. S. 569, 581–582 (1982). 
در سطح بالا، برنامه SSI به شرح زیر عمل می‌کند. افرادی که بالای 65 سال، نابینا یا معلول هستند، در صورتی که درآمد سالانه و منابع مالی آنها کمتر از یک سطح تعیین شده خاص باشد، می‌توانند درخواست دهند و در برنامه SSI ثبت نام کنند. 42 U. S. C. §§1381, 1382(a)(1), (c)(7). پس از تأیید - و تا زمانی که ثبت نام خاتمه یابد - درآمد سالانه فردی که در برنامه SSI ثبت نام کرده است، بالاتر از حداقل فدرال تضمین می‌شود. به §1382(b) مراجعه کنید. این لزوماً به این معنی نیست که چنین ثبت نام کننده‌ای هر ماه (یا حتی اصلاً) از دولت چک دریافت خواهد کرد - که به سایر عوامل مشخص شده بستگی دارد. به §1382(c) مراجعه کنید. اما اگر در هر ماه درآمد یک ثبت نام کننده از نرخ مورد نیاز برای رسیدن به حداقل فدرال کمتر شود، دولت با ارسال ... این کمبود را جبران می‌کند. به آنها چک بدهید. به همانجا مراجعه کنید. 
در اینجا مکث می‌کنم تا خاطرنشان کنم که شرکت در برنامه SSI برای ثبت‌نام‌کنندگان بسیار مفید است، صرف نظر از اینکه آیا آنها در هر ماه خاصی به چک نیاز دارند و آن را دریافت می‌کنند یا خیر. دلیل این امر این است که ثبت‌نام در SSI به شرکت‌کنندگان اطمینان خاطر معناداری می‌دهد. فقر در آمریکا طاعونی از عدم قطعیت است که با بی‌ثباتی مداوم مشخص می‌شود - چیزی که دیگران آن را "ترس مداوم از بدتر شدن اوضاع" نامیده‌اند. ام. دزموند، فقر، توسط آمریکا 17 (2023). مشکل فقط این نیست که درآمد فرد خیلی کم است؛ بلکه این است که درآمد فرد، همانطور که هست، بسیار بی‌ثبات است. "برای بسیاری از کارگران آمریکایی، دستمزدها... ناپایدار هستند و نه تنها سال به سال، بلکه ماه به ماه، حتی هفته به هفته، به شدت در نوسان هستند." همان، صفحه 16. همانطور که زنی که در آستانه فقر زندگی می‌کند، وضعیت خود را اینگونه توصیف کرد: "هر روز و هر شب که سعی می‌کنم بخوابم، این نگرانی وجود دارد... چطور قراره انجامش بدم؟ چطور می‌تونم برای پرداخت این قبض‌ها تلاش کنم؟ اگر یک اتفاق اضافی بیفتد—» دی. شیپلر، فقرای شاغل ۲۵ (۲۰۰۴).
کنگره این واقعیت را درک کرد وقتی که تصمیم گرفت یک شبکه امنیت اجتماعی مرتبط با درآمد برای جمعیتی که تحت پوشش SSI هستند، ایجاد کند. در واقع، برنامه SSI به طور خاص برای رسیدگی به وضعیت اغلب ناتوان‌کننده نوسانات کم درآمد طراحی شده است. اگر فردی که در آستانه فقر است در برنامه SSI ثبت نام کند، خیالش راحت است که اگر به دلیل خرابی ماشینش، بیمار شدن فرزندش یا کاهش ناگهانی ساعات کاری‌اش از کار بیفتد، همچنان می‌تواند قبوض را پرداخت کند زیرا دولت در صورت نیاز مقداری پول نقد در اختیار او قرار می‌دهد. این «مزیت» واقعی SSI است - یک چیز کمتر برای نگرانی.
این درک اولیه از برنامه SSI همچنین به روشن شدن ذینفعان کمک می‌کند (یعنی توضیح می‌دهد که چه کسی «حق» دریافت مزایای SSI را برای اهداف آن طرح قانونی دارد): هر کسی که طبق معیارهای قانونی آستانه، در ابتدا توسط شبکه امنیت SSI محافظت شود به عبارت دیگر، فرد «مستحق» هر فردی است که حق دریافت پرداخت‌های SSI را دارد، زمانی که درآمدش کمتر از حداقل فدرال باشد.

متن و ساختار قانون SSI به وضوح با این درک از مزایای SSI و معنای «مستحق بودن» برای آن مطابقت دارد. اولین ماده اساسی زیرفصل SSI - به ویژه با عنوان «استحقاق اولیه برای مزایا» - وعده می‌دهد: «به هر فرد مسن، نابینا یا معلولی که بر اساس درآمد و منابع خود واجد شرایط تشخیص داده شود... مطابق با و تابع مفاد این زیرفصل، مزایا پرداخت خواهد شد.» بند ۱۳۸۱a (تأکید اضافه شده است؛ حروف پررنگ حذف شده است). این به اندازه کافی واضح است. اما کدام افراد «بر اساس درآمد و منابعشان واجد شرایط هستند»؟ این سوال با بند بعدی، بند ۱۳۸۲(a)، پاسخ داده شده است که توضیح می‌دهد هر «فرد مسن، نابینا یا معلول» با درآمد و منابع مالی سالانه کمتر از یک آستانه مشخص، «فرد واجد شرایط برای اهداف این زیرفصل خواهد بود.» بخش ۱۳۸۲ سپس توضیح می‌دهد که یک فرد واجد شرایط تحت این برنامه واجد چه شرایطی است. بند فرعی (ب) پرداخت‌های هر فرد واجد شرایط را از دولت تا سطح حداقل درآمد فدرال تعریف‌شده قانونی در طول یک سال تضمین می‌کند که به میزان درآمد قابل احتساب آن فرد برای آن سال کاهش می‌یابد. §۱۳۸۲(ب). و بند فرعی (ج) مقرر می‌کند که افراد واجد شرایط در هر ماهی که درآمد ماهانه آنها کمتر از مبلغ مورد نیاز برای کسب حداقل درآمد فدرال در طول یک سال باشد، پرداخت نقدی دریافت خواهند کرد. §۱۳۸۲(ج)(۱). 
در مجموع: قانون SSI بین حق ثبت‌نام در برنامه SSI - که در §۱۳۸۱a با معیارهای واجد شرایط بودن مندرج در §۱۳۸۲(الف) وعده داده شده است - و حق دریافت پرداخت تحت این برنامه تمایز قائل می‌شود. هر کسی که در دسته اول قرار گیرد، از مزایای بسیار ارزشمند شبکه ایمنی بهره‌مند می‌شود.ثبت نام در SSI (و آرامش خاطری که با آن همراه است)، چه واقعاً در هر ماه خاص از دولت چک دریافت کنند یا نه.

ب
از آنجا که اکثریت ماهیت برنامه‌ای SSI را درک نمی‌کنند، مزایای SSI به چک ماهانه کاهش می‌یابد - و نه چیزی بیشتر. از این فرض، اکثریت نتیجه می‌گیرند که تمام چیزی که کنگره هنگام اندازه‌گیری جمعیت کم‌درآمد بیمارستان برای اهداف فرمول سهم نامتناسب مدیکر به آن اهمیت می‌داد، تعداد بیمارانی بود که در طول ماه بستری در بیمارستان چک دریافت کردند. اما اکثریت همچنین اذعان می‌کنند که نکته فرمول سهم نامتناسب مدیکر شناسایی «بیمارستان‌هایی است که به «درصد غیرمعمول بالایی از بیماران کم‌درآمد» خدمت می‌کنند.» «قبل از آن، در ۲. و اینکه آیا فردی در یک ماه خاص از دولت چک دریافت کرده است یا خیر، دسته‌بندی گسترده‌تر «کم‌درآمد» بیماران را دنبال نمی‌کند - و در واقع، ارتباط چندانی با آن ندارد. نتیجه، تفسیری از فرمول است که نه تنها به طرز عجیبی بیماران کم‌درآمد را که مسلماً بی‌شک کم‌درآمد هستند، مستثنی می‌کند، بلکه این کار را خودسرانه انجام می‌دهد.


زنی را تصور کنید که سال‌هاست واجد شرایط دریافت پرداخت‌های SSI بوده و در یک فروشگاه خرده‌فروشی کار می‌کند - من او را «آن» می‌نامم. در ژانویه، «آن» چند شیفت شب می‌گیرد که بیشتر از شیفت‌های معمول روزانه‌اش حقوق می‌دهد. رجوع کنید به شیپلر، «فقیران شاغل»، در ۶۵ سالگی. این درآمد اضافی او را از آستانه پرداخت نقدی SSI بالاتر می‌برد، بنابراین او در ژانویه پولی دریافت نمی‌کند. اما در فوریه (و مارس، آوریل و مه)، وقتی برنامه‌اش به حالت عادی برمی‌گردد، درآمدش به زیر آستانه کاهش می‌یابد. از نظر اکثریت، اینکه آیا «آن» برای اهداف فرمول سهم نامتناسب به عنوان یک بیمار کم‌درآمد محسوب می‌شود یا خیر، به اتفاق بستری شدن او در بیمارستان بستگی دارد. اگر او در فوریه دچار حمله قلبی شود، در بیمارستان بستری می‌شود. اما اگر قلبش در ژانویه از کار بیفتد، از بیمارستان مرخص می‌شود.


چرا کنگره قصد داشت «آن» را از آمار بیماران کم‌درآمد بیمارستان در ژانویه حذف کند اما او را در فوریه لحاظ کند؟ پاسخ ساده است: این اتفاق نیفتاد. از این گذشته، فرمول سهم نامتناسب مربوط به جریان نقدی شخصی «آن» نیست - کنگره در تلاش برای شناسایی بیمارانی که پول نقد کافی ندارند، نبود. در عوض، همانطور که همه موافقند، این فرمول در تلاش است بیمارانی را که به دلیل تأثیرات فقر بر سلامت، درمان آنها پرهزینه‌تر خواهد بود، در نظر بگیرد. از دیدگاه بیمارستان (و جامعه)، هیچ تفاوتی در هزینه بین درمان «آن» در ژانویه (زمانی که کمی پول نقد بیشتری داشت) یا درمان او در فوریه (زمانی که کمی پول نقد کمتری داشت) وجود ندارد. در هر دو ماه، از نظر هزینه‌های درمانی نسبتاً بیشتر بیمارستان، «آن» به عنوان یک بیمار کم‌درآمد شناخته می‌شود. 
غیرمنطقی بودن برداشت اکثریت به همین جا ختم نمی‌شود. طبق نظر اکثریت، بیمارانی که در اولین ماه واجد شرایط بودن برای SSI در بیمارستان بستری می‌شوند، خارج از صورت کسر فرمول مدیکر قرار می‌گیرند، زیرا طبق قانون، پرداخت‌های SSI تا ماه دوم واجد شرایط بودن شروع نمی‌شوند. به بند 1382(c)(7) مراجعه کنید. سایر ویژگی‌های طرح قانونی SSI - مانند بندی که مانع از دریافت پرداخت SSI توسط افراد در خانه‌های سالمندان تحت پوشش مدیکید در هر ماهی که بیش از 30 دلار درآمد دارند می‌شود، بند 1382(e)(1)(B) - به همین ترتیب به این معنی است که بسیاری از بیماران کم‌درآمد به طور خودسرانه از محاسبه فرمول سهم نامتناسب حذف می‌شوند. هیچ یک از این شرایط هیچ ارتباطی با هزینه ارائه مراقبت‌های بهداشتی با کیفیت به چنین بیمارانی ندارد.1

اکثریت به این ناسازگاری‌ها اشاره نمی‌کنند، چه رسد به اینکه آنها را توجیه کنند. در عوض، تمام عجایب ظاهری تفسیر خود را نادیده می‌گیرد و با بی‌خیالی خاطرنشان می‌کند که «هیچ قانونی به هر قیمتی یک سیاست واحد را دنبال نمی‌کند.» آنته، در صفحه ۱۵ (پرانتز حذف شده). من فکر می‌کنم نمایندگان مردم شایسته اعتبار بیشتری هستند تا اینکه این دادگاه به این نتیجه برسد که آنها عمداً قانونی را تصویب کرده‌اند که به اهداف خود نمی‌رسد و آنقدر خودسرانه عمل می‌کند که هیچ معنایی ندارد. 
از نظر اکثریت، روش من برای تجزیه و تحلیل قوانین مربوطه، به طور غیرمجاز هدف را بر متن ترجیح می‌دهد، زیرا «نادیده می‌گیرد که کنگره وسیله خاصی را برای پیشبرد هدف خود انتخاب کرده است.» آنته، در صفحه ۱۵. اما این ادعا به سادگی این سوال را پیش روی ما قرار می‌دهد؛ کاری که اکنون انجام می‌دهیم تلاش برای تشخیص این است که کنگره هنگام ارجاع به برنامه SSI هنگام تدوین بخش مدیکر، چه چیزی را «انتخاب» کرده است. ظاهراً اکثریت معتقد است که می‌تواند بدون در نظر گرفتن اینکه بخش مدیکر برای چه چیزی طراحی شده است، این را بفهمد - آنها فقط، عمدتاً با همان استدلال، اصرار دارند که کنگره یک معیار برای وضعیت کم‌درآمد «انتخاب» کرده است که می‌پرسد آیا بیمار در طول ماه بستری در بیمارستان، چک SSI دریافت کرده است یا خیر. قبل از آن، در ساعت ۸-۹، ۱۵. پاسخ من به سادگی این است که چرا کنگره احتمالاً چنین انتخابی می‌کند؟ غیرمنطقی بودن تفسیر اکثریت به شدت نشان می‌دهد که آنچه اکثریت معتقد است کنگره «انتخاب» کرده است، در واقع آن چیزی نیست که کنگره قصد یا انجام آن را داشته است.

همچنین نیازی به نتیجه‌گیری نیست که کنگره عمداً چنین معیار غیرمنطقی و خودسرانه‌ای را انتخاب کرده است.وقتی تفسیر به همان اندازه (اگر نه بیشتر) قابل قبول دیگری در دسترس باشد: اینکه کنگره قصد داشته بیمارانی را که در زمان خدمت‌رسانی بیمارستان به آنها در برنامه SSI ثبت‌نام کرده بودند، به حساب آورد. قوانین «تمرین‌های بی‌اثر در انشای ادبی نیستند»، بلکه «ابزارهای دولت» هستند. ایالات متحده علیه شیری، 359 U. S. 255, 260 (1959). ما به آن قانون - و شاخه برابر دولت که آن را تصویب کرده است - بی‌احترامی می‌کنیم وقتی که منطق قوانینی را که کنگره طراحی می‌کند، درک نمی‌کنیم یا قدر نمی‌دانیم.

ج

دلیل دیگری نیز وجود دارد که رویکرد کوته‌بینانه اکثریت در تفسیر قوانین در این مورد نتیجه اشتباهی به بار آورده است. همانطور که اکثریت برنامه SSI را پیش‌بینی می‌کنند، حق بیمار برای SSI هر ماه بسته به جریان نقدی او تغییر می‌کند. این دیدگاه در مورد نحوه عملکرد برنامه کاملاً با خوانش کاملاً زمینه‌مند شده‌ای که در بخش II-A ارائه داده‌ام، مغایرت دارد. همچنین با متن ساده قانون که به وضوح حق SSI را فراتر از یک ماه در نظر می‌گیرد، در تضاد است.

برای درک اینکه چگونه اکثریت در این مورد اشتباه می‌کنند، از جایی شروع کنید که اکثریت انجام می‌دهند: با زبان §1382(c) - بندی که توضیح می‌دهد چگونه و چه زمانی مزایای نقدی SSI پرداخت خواهد شد. به ante، در بند 7 مراجعه کنید. با شروع از آنجا، اکثریت اساساً §§1382(a) و (b) را نادیده می‌گیرند، که به وضوح به چه کسی حق دریافت مزایای SSI را می‌دهد و به دلیل این حق واجد شرایط دریافت چه چیزی هستند. همچنین به Schweiker v. Wilson، 450 U. S. 221, 223, n. 2 (1981) مراجعه کنید ("برای واجد شرایط بودن برای مزایای SSI،" "درآمد و منابع یک شخص باید کمتر از سطوح مشخص شده در ... 42 U. S. C. §1382(a) باشد")؛ سالیوان علیه زبلی، 493 U. S. 521, 524 (1990) ("شخصی واجد شرایط دریافت مزایای SSI است که درآمد و منابع مالی او کمتر از سطح معینی باشد، §1382(a)، و اگر "معلول" باشد". علاوه بر این، و برای اهداف فعلی مهم است که واجد شرایط بودن در بند (a) به درآمد فرد در طول یک "سال تقویمی" نگاه می‌کند - نه درآمد او در هر ماه خاص. §1382(a)(1)(A). بنابراین، متن این قانون، به طور کلی، به وضوح نشان می‌دهد که واجد شرایط بودن برای مزایای SSI در افق زمانی طولانی‌تری نسبت به آنچه اکثریت اذعان می‌کنند، عمل می‌کند.

سایر مقررات همچنین نشان می‌دهند که اینکه آیا کسی "مستحق" دریافت مزایای SSI است یا خیر، به درآمد او در یک ماه واحد مربوط نمی‌شود. پس از اینکه فردی برای دریافت SSI درخواست داد و طبق ماده ۱۳۸۲(a) واجد شرایط شناخته شد، نیازی به درخواست مجدد در ماه بعد - یا در واقع، هیچ ماهی پس از آن - ندارد، زیرا واجد شرایط بودن او برای دریافت مزایا تا زمانی که درآمدش برای یک سال کامل بسیار بالا شود، §۱۳۸۳(j)(1)؛ ۲۰ CFR §۴۱۶.۱۳۳۵، یا تا زمانی که ثبت نام او به دلیل دیگری خاتمه یابد، §۱۳۸۳(e)(1)(A)؛ ۲۰ CFR §§۴۱۶.۱۳۳۱، ۴۱۶.۱۳۳۳–۴۱۶.۱۳۳۴، ادامه دارد. به نظر می‌رسد این قانون همچنین یک رابطه بلندمدت با مزایا را در نظر دارد، تا جایی که به وزارت بهداشت و خدمات انسانی (HHS) اجازه می‌دهد در شرایط خاص، مزایای SSI را «به تعویق بیندازد (در صورت وجود حق اولیه) یا به حالت تعلیق درآورد (در صورت وجود حق موجود)» - تمایزی که فقط در صورتی منطقی است که حق فرد برای SSI بیش از یک ماه ادامه داشته باشد. §1383(a)(2)(B)(viii) (تأکید اضافه شده است)؛ همچنین به §1382c(a)(3)(H)(ii)(I) مراجعه کنید (اشاره به «واجد شرایط بودن مداوم» فرد برای مزایا در طول چندین سال). 
اگر همه اینها هنوز برای تشخیص دقیق محدوده‌های گسترده‌تر این برنامه توسط اکثریت کافی نیست، این واقعیت را در نظر بگیرید که HHS از متقاضیان SSI می‌خواهد که به آژانس اجازه دسترسی به سوابق مالی خود را بدهند تا HHS بتواند به طور خودکار درآمد آنها را رصد کند. §1383(e)(1)(B)(ii)؛ 20 CFR §416.207. این مجوز تا «پایان واجد شرایط بودن دریافت‌کننده برای مزایا تحت این زیرفصل» ادامه دارد. §1383(e)(1)(B)(ii)(II)(bb). اما اگر واجد شرایط بودن برای مزایای SSI یک تصمیم ماهانه بود، قانون «سوابق خود را به ما بدهید» هیچ کاری انجام نمی‌داد. داشتن مجوز دسترسی به آن سوابق برای یک ماه و فقط یک ماه برای آژانس فایده‌ای ندارد.

واقعیت‌های عملی مدیریت SSI همچنین نشان می‌دهد که حق SSI ماه به ماه تعیین نمی‌شود. به عنوان مثال، مزایای SSI در روز اول ماه پرداخت می‌شود - یک فرد پرداخت فوریه خود را در اول فوریه دریافت می‌کند. 20 CFR §416.502. بنابراین، با دیدگاه حق فقط ماهانه، اکثریت ظاهراً حدس می‌زنند که HHS به طور منظم مزایا را پرداخت می‌کند بدون اینکه بداند آیا دریافت‌کننده اصلاً واجد شرایط SSI است یا خیر. هرگونه سیاستی از این دست به طرز شگفت‌آوری غیرمسئولانه خواهد بود. اما اگر SSI برنامه‌ای باشد که بیش از یک ماه ادامه داشته باشد، پرداخت‌های روز اول هم منطقی و هم از نظر اداری امکان‌پذیر است. به یاد داشته باشید که ما در مورد افرادی صحبت می‌کنیم که به شدت به پول نقد برای پرداخت صورتحساب‌های ماهانه خود نیاز دارند؛ این امر، رویه آژانس در ارائه پرداخت‌های سریع و آینده‌نگر را توضیح می‌دهد، که نظارت بر درآمد فوق‌الذکر آن را تسهیل می‌کند. علاوه بر این، همانطور که توضیح دادم، هنگامی که فردی برای SSI تأیید می‌شود، حق دارد تا زمان ثبت‌نام خود، در صورت نیاز، چنین پرداخت‌های آینده‌نگر را دریافت کند.خاتمه می‌یابد. با اتخاذ یک افق زمانی گسترده‌تر از یک ماه که پرداخت در آن انجام می‌شود، آژانس می‌تواند پول را به فرد نیازمند برساند و سپس متعاقباً هرگونه پرداخت بیش از حد (یا کمتر از حد) را که انجام می‌دهد، با بررسی حقوق واقعی فرد برای ماه مورد نظر و در صورت لزوم، تنظیم مبلغی که در ماه‌های بعد پرداخت می‌کند، هموار کند. به بند ۱۳۸۳(ب) مراجعه کنید.

اکثریت به سادگی این نوع ویژگی‌های برنامه‌ای را که با خوانش آن مغایرت دارد، نادیده می‌گیرد. و مفاد قانونی بی‌فایده‌ای که اکثریت اذعان می‌کنند، از نظر آنها نادیده گرفته می‌شوند. در یک پاورقی، اکثریت آنها را صرفاً به عنوان "خانه‌داری" قانونگذاری رد می‌کند. Ante، در ۱۲، شماره ۵. من قبول دارم که طفره رفتن از کار کنگره آسان‌تر از توضیح پیامدهای انتخاب‌های مختلف سیاستی آن است. اما اگر اکثریت بخواهد تفسیر خود را منحصراً بر اساس آنچه کنگره هنگام استفاده از اصطلاح «واجد شرایط بودن» «انتخاب» کرده است، قرار دهد، باید با تمام کاربردهای این اصطلاح در قانون مورد بحث - نه فقط مواردی که از قرائت ترجیحی آن پشتیبانی می‌کنند - دست و پنجه نرم کند.2

قابل توجه است که طراحی قانونی که برنامه SSI را ایجاد می‌کند - معیارهای اساسی که حق دریافت مزایا را تعیین می‌کند، که طبق آن افراد تحت شرایط خاصی که در جای دیگر مشخص شده‌اند، واجد شرایط دریافت پرداخت هستند - منحصر به SSI نیست. به عنوان مثال، مزایای جانبازان را در نظر بگیرید. یک جانباز «با دوره لازم خدمت سربازی، «مستحق» دریافت مزایای آموزشی خاصی می‌شود، «معمولاً به شکل حقوق یا پرداخت شهریه». Rudisill v. McDonough, 601 U. S. 294, 299 (2024) (تأکید اضافه شده است). اما صرفاً به این دلیل که شخصی واجد شرایط دریافت آن مزایا است، به این معنی نیست که او هرگز آنها را دریافت خواهد کرد. حلقه‌هایی وجود دارد که او باید از آنها عبور کند و شرایطی که باید برای واجد شرایط بودن برای دریافت پرداخت، آنها را برآورده کند. همان، صفحات 300-301. 
یا بخش A بیمه درمانی مدیکر را در نظر بگیرید. «وقتی شخصی 65 ساله می‌شود،» او «مستحق» دریافت مزایای بخش A بیمه درمانی مدیکر می‌شود. Empire Health, 597 U. S., 428 (به نقل از 42 U. S. C. §§426(a)–(b)). در آنجا نیز، استحقاق، پرداخت را تضمین نمی‌کند - ممکن است شخصی مستحق دریافت مزایای بخش A بیمه درمانی مدیکر باشد، اما هرگز حتی یک سنت هم دریافت نکند، شاید به این دلیل که تحت پوشش بیمه درمانی خصوصی است، یا به این دلیل که به سقف قانونی مراقبت رسیده است. 597 U. S., 432. همانطور که این دادگاه تشخیص داده است، «استحقاق دریافت مزایای [بخش A بیمه درمانی مدیکر]» صرفاً «استحقاق دریافت پرداخت تحت شرایط مشخص» است. همان، صفحات 436 (برخی تأکیدها حذف شده‌اند). همین امر در مورد SSI نیز صادق است. بند 426(c)(1) (که توضیح می‌دهد «حق یک فرد» برای دریافت مزایای بخش A مدیکر «شامل حق دریافت پرداخت تحت و با رعایت محدودیت‌های بخش A است») را با بند 1381a (که بیان می‌کند «حق اساسی دریافت مزایای [SSI]» شامل وعده پرداخت به افراد خاص «مطابق و تابع مفاد زیرفصل [SSI]» است (پررنگ حذف شده است)) مقایسه کنید.

III
دقیقاً همین تمایز - بین آستانه حق شرکت در یک برنامه مزایا، از یک سو، و حق بعدی برای دریافت پرداخت تحت آن برنامه، از سوی دیگر - بود که تنها سه دوره پیش، محور تفسیر ما از بخش دیگری از فرمول سهم نامتناسب بود. در پرونده امپایر هلث، ما با سوالی مواجه شدیم که اساساً مشابه سوالی است که دادگاه امروز مطرح می‌کند: کدام بیماران برای اهداف فرمول سهم نامتناسب، «حق دریافت» مزایای بخش A مدیکر را دارند؟ 597 U. S.، صفحه 428. علاوه بر این، استدلال‌های موجود در آن پرونده، استدلال‌هایی را که اکنون بررسی می‌کنیم، منعکس می‌کرد. یک طرف معتقد بود که بیمار فقط در صورتی «حق دریافت» چنین مزایایی را دارد که واقعاً مبلغی از مدیکر دریافت کرده باشد؛ طرف دیگر اصرار داشت که بیمار در صورتی که واجد شرایط برنامه بخش A مدیکر باشد، چنین حقی دارد و نیازی به پرداخت وجه نیست. به همان، صفحه 432-433 مراجعه کنید. با این حال، نکته قابل توجه این است که ارزش استدلال‌ها وارونه شد - در پرونده امپایر هلث، بیمارستان‌ها بودند که اصرار داشتند پرداخت وجه الزامی است، در حالی که دولت ادعا می‌کرد که واجد شرایط بودن برای برنامه کافی است. همان.

ما طرف دولت را گرفتیم. ما معتقدیم که یک بیمار در صورتی «مستحق» دریافت مزایای بخش A مدیکر است که «معیارهای قانونی اساسی» برنامه بخش A مدیکر را داشته باشد، چه «واقعاً برای یک روز مشخص درمان، وجهی دریافت کرده باشد» یا نه. همان، صفحه ۴۳۵. برای اهداف فرمول سهم نامتناسب، گفتیم که دریافت وجه توسط بیمار اهمیتی ندارد. تمام چیزی که فرمول به آن اهمیت می‌دهد این است که آیا بیمار واجد شرایط برنامه‌ای است که او را تحت شرایط مشخص، مستحق دریافت وجه می‌کند یا خیر. همان، صفحه ۴۳۶.
دقیقاً همین منطق باید اینجا هم مطرح می‌شد. یک بیمار در صورتی «مستحق دریافت» مزایای SSI است که «معیارهای قانونی اساسی» برنامه SSI را داشته باشد، چه «واقعاً در ماه مربوطه، وجهی از SSI دریافت کرده باشد یا نه». همان، صفحات ۴۳۲، ۴۳۵. به عبارت دیگر، درست مانند بخش A بیمه درمانی مدیکر، حق قانونی برای دریافت SSI «با محدودیت‌های پرداخت همراه است». همان، صفحات ۴۳۶.
استدلال ما در Empire Health منجر به این شد که بیمارستان‌ها دوباره...دریافت پول کمتر از طریق عملیات بخش مدیکر. همان، صفحه ۴۴۴. در اینجا، همین منطق ایجاب می‌کند که آنها بیشتر دریافت کنند، زیرا بیماران بیشتری را در صورت کسر مدیکر قرار می‌دهد. اما به جای پیروی صرف از Empire Health در جایی که منتهی می‌شود، اکثریت از دیدگاه روشن و قابل اجرا خود فاصله می‌گیرند. از نظر اکثریت، اگرچه یک بیمار برای "استحقاق" بخش A مدیکر به منظور فرمول سهم نامتناسب، نیازی به دریافت پرداختی بخش A مدیکر ندارد، اما باید پرداختی SSI دریافت کند تا تحت همان محاسبه "استحقاق" SSI داشته باشد. 
برای توجیه این انحراف گیج‌کننده، اکثریت دو "تمایز حیاتی" را مشخص می‌کند که می‌گویند SSI را از بخش A مدیکر متمایز می‌کند و بنابراین این مورد را از Empire Health متفاوت می‌کند. Ante، صفحه ۱۴. اول، اکثریت می‌گوید که مزایای بخش A مدیکر "فراتر از پرداخت‌های مشخص برای هر نیاز پزشکی خاص است"، در حالی که مزایای SSI "شامل پرداخت‌های نقدی ماهانه و نه چیز دیگری است". همان. من قبلاً توضیح داده‌ام که چرا این توصیف از SSI اشتباه است: مزایای SSI صرفاً خودِ پرداخت نیست، بلکه وعده پرداخت در زمان نیاز است. سوپرا، در صفحه ۵-۶. بنابراین SSI درست مانند بیمه درآمد عمل می‌کند. به افراد ثبت‌نام‌شده وعده پرداخت داده می‌شود، در صورتی که رویداد محرک مربوطه - درآمد ماهانه کمتر از آستانه - رخ دهد.

اکثریت این نتیجه‌گیری عقل سلیم را بر اساس توصیفات سطحی نادرست از برنامه SSI و معنای آن برای افرادی که به آن متکی هستند، رد می‌کنند. بنابراین، SSI معمولاً به عنوان یک "برنامه رفاهی" توصیف می‌شود، در صفحه ۱۳ - خب که چی؟ این برچسب این واقعیت را تغییر نمی‌دهد که این برنامه رفاهی بیشتر شبیه بیمه عمل می‌کند تا یارانه. به نظر می‌رسد اکثریت معتقدند که برنامه‌های بیمه ممکن است از ذینفعان فقط در برابر افزایش هزینه‌ها محافظت کنند - نه کاهش درآمد. همانجا. اما چرا اینطور است؟ از نظر اقتصادی، افزایش هزینه‌ها و کاهش درآمد دو روی یک سکه هستند. تنها تفاوت، عامل تسریع‌کننده است، و البته، این واقعیت که گونه‌های بیمه با درآمد کاهش‌یافته، واقعیت ناامنی درآمد را تصدیق می‌کنند.

دومین تمایز اعلام‌شده، ادعای اکثریت است که بخش A مدیکر «خودکار و مداوم» است در حالی که SSI اینطور نیست. قبل از آن، در ساعت ۱۴. این از همان ابتدا نادرست به نظر می‌رسد، زیرا اکثریت اذعان می‌کنند که افراد دارای معلولیت می‌توانند در صورت کاهش معلولیت خود، حق خود را برای بخش A مدیکر از دست بدهند. همان. بنابراین، جای سوال است که آیا بخش A مدیکر در واقع «مداوم» است یا خیر. در هر صورت، اکثریت توضیح نمی‌دهند که چرا این تمایز «مداوم» تفاوتی ایجاد می‌کند. سوال پیش روی ما این است که آیا یک فرد برای اهداف فرمول سهم نامتناسب «مستحق» SSI است، نه اینکه آیا یک فرد باید دوباره درخواست دهد تا چنین حقی پیدا کند، یا اینکه آیا می‌توان از فهرست این برنامه مزایا حذف شد یا خیر.


در نهایت، هیچ یک از تمایزات «حیاتی» که اکثریت بین بخش A مدیکر و SSI قائل می‌شوند، اصلاً حیاتی نیستند. بنابراین، در غیاب هرگونه مبنای اصولی برای تمایز این پرونده از Empire Health، اکثریت به لفاظی‌های مختصر و مفید متوسل می‌شوند و با کنایه می‌گویند: «اینکه بگوییم افراد در ماه‌هایی که حتی واجد شرایط دریافت مزایا نیستند، «حق» دریافت آنها را دارند، منطقی نیست.» آنته، در صفحه ۱۲. باز هم، این توصیف، مزیت واقعی SSI را نادرست نشان می‌دهد. همچنین قابل توجه است که، در حالی که برخی در این دادگاه استدلال مشابهی را در Empire Health پذیرفتند، این کار را با مخالفت انجام دادند. به ۵۹۷ U. S.، در صفحات ۴۴۷-۴۴۸ (نظر KAVANAUGH, J.) مراجعه کنید (استدلال می‌کند که اگر بیمار طبق قانون نتواند» مبلغی دریافت کند، نمی‌توان او را «حق» دریافت مزایای بخش A مدیکر دانست). دیدگاه اکثریت در Empire Health ماهیت بیمه‌مانند برنامه Medicare را کاملاً درک می‌کرد و استدلال آن کاملاً در مورد سؤالی که امروز به آن می‌پردازیم صدق می‌کند.

تصمیمی که اکثریت در این مورد اتخاذ کرده‌اند، بیمارستان‌هایی را که به نیازمندترین افراد در میان ما خدمت می‌کنند، از بودجه‌های حیاتی فدرال که کنگره آشکارا سعی در تأمین آن داشت، محروم خواهد کرد. بیمارستان‌هایی که سهم نامتناسبی از بیماران کم‌درآمد دارند، با مشکل مواجه هستند. در واقع، شکی نیست که شمارش کمتر از حد معمول بیماران کم‌درآمد برای اهداف فرمول سهم نامتناسب ممکن است باعث شود بسیاری از این بیمارستان‌ها به طور کامل تعطیل شوند، به طوری که به بیماران فقیرترین جوامع کشورمان اصلاً خدمات ارائه نشود. خلاصه برای انجمن بیمارستان‌های آمریکا و همکاران، به عنوان Amici Curiae 27-28؛ ترجمه Oral Arg. 36-38. 
این نتیجه ناشی از متن قانون Medicare یا شرایط پیرامون آن نیست. بلکه، متأسفانه، مستقیماً به روش بی‌توجه و بدون توجه به زمینه اکثریت در تحلیل قانونی نسبت داده می‌شود. اشاره کنگره به برنامه SSI در فرمول مدیکر، اکثریت را دچار سردرگمی کرده و آنها را به این فکر انداخته است که کنگره قصد داشته بیمارستان‌هایی که به بیماران کم‌درآمد خدمات ارائه می‌دهند، با نرخ‌های پایین‌تری نسبت به زمانی که جمعیت بیماران آنها به طور کامل در نظر گرفته می‌شود، بازپرداخت شوند. بنابراین، چنین نخواهد شد.این به کنگره بستگی دارد که قصد خود مبنی بر دسترسی افراد کم‌درآمد به مراقبت‌های پزشکی باکیفیت و جبران خسارت بیمارستان‌ها بر اساس آن را مجدداً بیان کند. 
من گمان می‌کنم که تدوین چنین راهکار قانونی خیلی دشوار نخواهد بود. اما اگر رویه‌های تفسیری این دادگاه صرفاً به ارزیابی متن قانون در کنار هرگونه هدف قانونی غیرقابل انکار توجه کند، کنگره نیازی به طی کردن این مسیر اضافی نخواهد داشت. در اینجا، ما باید به راحتی نتیجه می‌گرفتیم که، برای اهداف فرمول سهم نامتناسب مورد استفاده برای بازپرداخت بیمارستان‌ها، بیماران در صورت واجد شرایط بودن و ثبت‌نام در برنامه SSI، "حق دریافت" مزایای SSI را دارند، همانطور که کنگره بدون شک در نظر داشته است. ________________________________________
یادداشت‌ها
1 دولت حداقل پذیرفته است که تفسیرش یک قانون «رسید واقعی» نیست - دولت قول داده است که یک بیمار، حتی اگر واقعاً در یک ماه معین مبلغی از SSI دریافت نکند (مثلاً به دلیل نقل مکان فرد ثبت‌نام‌کننده یا گم شدن چک توسط اداره پست)، تا زمانی که «الزامات قانونی برای پرداخت نقدی در طول ماه مربوطه را برآورده کند»، محاسبه خواهد شد. Tr. of Oral Arg. 51. دولت همچنین به دادگاه اطمینان داد که بیمارانی را که در ابتدا به دلیل یک خطای اداری (مانند آدرس اشتباه در پرونده) که متعاقباً درمان شده است، در یک ماه معین مبلغی دریافت نکرده‌اند، «به صورت عطف به ماسبق» محاسبه خواهد کرد. همان، صفحه 52.
2 از طرف من، انکار نمی‌کنم که قانون SSI در مورد «واجد شرایط بودن فرد برای دریافت مزایا... به مدت یک ماه» بحث می‌کند. Ante، صفحه 7 (به نقل از §1382(c)(1)). اما، همانطور که توضیح دادم، آن شرایط واجد شرایط بودن ماهانه فقط برای توصیف مزایایی (یعنی پرداخت نقدی) است که فردی که واجد شرایط دریافت SSI است، واجد شرایط دریافت آن است. فوق، در صفحه ۷.
