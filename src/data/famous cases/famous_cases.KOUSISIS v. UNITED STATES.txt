certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the third circuit
________________________________________
No. 23–909. Argued December 9, 2024—Decided May 22, 2025
________________________________________
The Pennsylvania Department of Transportation (PennDOT) awarded petitioners Stamatios Kousisis and Alpha Painting and Construction Co. two contracts for painting projects in Philadelphia. Federal regulations required contract awardees to subcontract a portion of every contract to a disadvantaged business enterprise. So as part of the bidding process, Kousisis falsely represented that Alpha would obtain its paint supplies from Markias, Inc., a prequalified disadvantaged business. This was a lie. Unbeknownst to PennDOT, Kousisis arranged for Markias to function as a mere “pass-through” entity. As a pass-through, Markias did not provide any paint supplies. To the contrary, its only role was that of a paper pusher, funneling checks and invoices to and from Alpha’s actual suppliers. Not only did this arrangement contradict Kousisis’s prior representations, it also violated the requirement that disadvantaged businesses perform a “commercially useful function.” 49 CFR §26.55(c). In the end, however, Alpha performed the painting projects to PennDOT’s satisfaction and pocketed over $20 million in gross profit.
   The Government charged Alpha and Kousisis with wire fraud and conspiracy to commit the same. 18 U. S. C. §§1343, 1349. The charges were premised on the fraudulent-inducement theory—in other words, that petitioners had induced PennDOT to award them the painting contracts under materially false pretenses. After a jury convicted Alpha and Kousisis of wire fraud, they moved for acquittal. In their view, despite the lack of disadvantaged-business participation, PennDOT had received the full economic benefit of its bargain. So, petitioners contended, the Government could not prove that they had schemed to defraud PennDOT of “money or property” as §1343 requires. The  Third Circuit rejected this argument, deepening the division over the validity of a federal fraud conviction when the defendant did not seek to cause the victim net pecuniary loss.
Held: A defendant who induces a victim to enter into a transaction under materially false pretenses may be convicted of federal fraud even if the defendant did not seek to cause the victim economic loss. Pp. 5–20.
  (a) To convict Alpha and Kousisis, the Government needed to prove that they used the wires to execute a “scheme or artifice to defraud, or for obtaining money or property by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations, or promises.” §1343. Under this Court’s precedent, a defendant commits wire fraud only if he both engaged in deception and had money or property as an object of his fraud. See Ciminelli v. United States, 598 U. S. 306, 312. It follows from this rule, Alpha and Kousisis say, that a federal fraud conviction cannot stand unless the defendant sought to cause the victim net pecuniary loss. Not so. The fraudulent-inducement theory is consistent with both the text of §1343 and this Court’s precedent. Pp. 5–20.
   (1) The text of §1343 does not mention economic loss, let alone require it. In fact, Alpha and Kousisis’s conduct satisfied each element of §1343: They devised a scheme to “obtai[n] money” (tens of millions) from PennDOT through false representations about their compliance with the disadvantaged-business requirement. And while petitioners argue otherwise, a scheme may still constitute wire fraud even if the defendant provides something of value in return. To “obtain” means “to gain or attain possession,” Webster’s Third International Dictionary 1559, and money or property is no less “obtained” simply because something else is given in return. Pp. 7–8.
   (2) Petitioners argue that economic loss is inherent to the common-law understanding of fraud, a term that appears twice in the wire fraud statute. But when Congress uses a common-law term, the presumption that the term “brings [its] old soil with it” applies only to the extent that the term has a settled meaning. Sekhar v. United States, 570 U. S. 729, 733. At common law, the term “fraud” had an expansive reach; its elements and remedies depended on the plaintiff’s alleged injury. In contract-rescission actions or prosecutions for false pretenses, for example, most courts did not require the victim to show economic loss. Instead, it was sufficient that the victim had “received property of a different character or condition than [it] was promised,” even if of equal value. W. Keeton, D. Dobbs, R. Keeton, & D. Owen, Prosser and Keeton on Law of Torts §110, p. 766 (Prosser & Keeton). Stated otherwise, it was the deception-induced deprivation of property—not economic loss—that common-law courts generally deemed injurious. See Stillwell v. Rankin, 55 Mont. 130, 135, 174 P. 186, 187. Contrast the tort of deceit: To have a complete cause of action, the  plaintiff must have suffered economic loss. See Prosser & Keeton §110, at 765. In sum, then, the common law did not establish a general rule requiring economic loss in all fraud cases, so the Court will not read such a requirement into §1343. Pp. 8–13.
   (3) Petitioners concede that the common law did not require economic loss in every case. But their purported exception—cases in which either the plaintiff received “something different from what was promised” or the bargain “involv[ed] an item with unique qualities,” Reply Brief 15—lacks a driving principle. At the right level of specificity, anything can be described as “unique” or “different from” something else. Indeed, the common law has long embraced a different standard—namely, materiality—as the principled basis for distinguishing everyday misstatements from actionable fraud. Today, the Court reiterates “that materiality of falsehood is an element of,” and thus a limit on, the federal fraud statutes. Neder v. United States, 527 U. S. 1, 25. But because Alpha and Kousisis have not contested the materiality of their representations, the Court does not resolve the parties’ debate about the proper standard for materiality under §1343. Pp. 14–16.
  (b) The fraudulent-inducement theory is neither foreclosed by, nor inconsistent with, the Court’s precedent. The Court has twice rejected the argument that a fraud conviction depends on economic loss, first in Carpenter v. United States, 484 U. S. 19, and then in Shaw v. United States, 580 U. S. 63. And despite Alpha and Kousisis’s contrary arguments, the fraudulent-inducement theory does not permit a fraud conviction premised on mere interference with the State’s power to regulate. No matter the underlying theory of fraud, §1343 requires that “money or property” have been an object of the fraudster’s scheme. The money-or-property requirement also explains why the fraudulent-inducement theory does not, as petitioners maintain, collapse the distinction between the wire fraud statute and the statutes that prohibit conspiracies to defraud the United States, see 18 U. S. C. §371, and false or fraudulent statements in federal matters, see §1001. Nor does the theory undermine this Court’s precedent holding that, aside from the honest-services exception, §1343 does not “protect intangible interests unconnected to traditional property rights.” Ciminelli, 598 U. S., at 312. If a scheme instead targets some kind of intangible interest—for example, a citizen’s interest in “impartial government”—the fraudulent-inducement theory is inapplicable. McNally v. United States, 483 U. S. 350, 355. Finally, the fraudulent-inducement theory does not “repackage” the right-to-control theory rejected in Ciminelli. Unlike the right-to-control theory, fraudulent inducement does not treat “mere information as the protected interest.” 598 U. S., at 315. Rather, it protects money and property. Pp. 16–19.
   (c) The fraudulent-inducement theory does not risk turning every misrepresentation designed to induce a transaction into property fraud. Instead, the theory criminalizes a particular species of fraud, and the “demanding” materiality requirement substantially narrows the universe of actionable misrepresentations. Universal Health Services, Inc. v. United States ex rel. Escobar, 579 U. S. 176, 194. And while the wire fraud statute is broad, it is up to Congress, if it so chooses, to change it. P. 19.

STAMATIOS KOUSISIS, ET AL., PETITIONERS v. UNITED STATES
on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the third circuit
________________________________________
[May 22, 2025]
________________________________________
 JUSTICE BARRETT delivered the opinion of the Court.
 Stamatios Kousisis and the industrial-painting company he helped manage, Alpha Painting and Construction Co., secured two government contracts for painting projects in Philadelphia. Both contracts required the participation of a disadvantaged business—and in its bids for the projects, Alpha represented to the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation (PennDOT) that it would obtain its materials from a qualifying supplier. See 49 CFR §§26.21(a), 26.5 (2024). This promise turned out to be an empty one: In addition to using the supplier solely as a pass-through entity, Alpha and Kousisis submitted multiple false certifications to cover up their scheme. So although Alpha’s paint work met expectations, its adherence to the disadvantaged- business requirement did not.
 The Government charged Alpha and Kousisis with wire fraud, asserting that they had fraudulently induced PennDOT to award them the painting contracts. See 18 U. S. C. §1343. Under the fraudulent-inducement theory, a defendant commits federal fraud whenever he uses a material misstatement to trick a victim into a contract that requires handing over her money or property—regardless of whether  the fraudster, who often provides something in return, seeks to cause the victim net pecuniary loss. We must decide whether this theory is consistent with §1343, which reaches only those schemes that target traditional money or property interests. See Ciminelli v. United States, 598 U. S. 306, 316 (2023). It is, so we affirm.
I
 When two Philadelphia landmarks, the Girard Point Bridge and the 30th Street Station, fell into disrepair, PennDOT began soliciting bids for their restoration. Kousisis, Alpha’s project manager, submitted a bid for each project. His bidding proved successful: With respect to the Girard Point project, PennDOT awarded a $70.3 million contract to a joint venture comprising Alpha and two other companies. And with respect to the 30th Street project, Alpha and another company (again operating as a joint venture) secured a $15 million subcontract, which represented nearly a third of the $50.8 million total winning bid.
 Federal grants from the U. S. Department of Transportation (DOT) accounted for a large portion of the funding for each project. As a result, both the State and Federal Governments had a say in how the projects were completed. Relevant here, DOT requires that grant recipients  like PennDOT establish and “actively implemen[t]” a  disadvantaged-business program. 49 CFR §§26.21, 26.39(c); see also 112 Stat. 113–115. A “[d]isadvantaged [b]usiness [e]nterprise,” according to DOT, is “a for-profit small business” that is majority owned and controlled by “one or more individuals who are both socially and economically disadvantaged.” §26.5 (italics omitted). Because DOT aspires to devote at least 10 percent of federal grant funding to such businesses, grant recipients must set “overall goal[s]” for disadvantaged-business participation in their “DOT-assisted contracts.” §§26.41, 26.45(a)(1).
  Consistent with this rule, PennDOT required that bidders for the Girard Point and 30th Street projects commit to subcontracting a percentage of the total contract amount—six and seven percent, respectively—to a disadvantaged business. Failing to comply with this requirement would constitute “a material breach” and could “result in [contract] termination.” App. 114, 175. Accordingly, as part of the bidding process, Kousisis represented that Alpha would acquire approximately $6.4 million in painting supplies from Markias, Inc., a prequalified disadvantaged business.
 This was a lie. As later memorialized in a commitment letter, Alpha and Kousisis concocted a scheme in which Markias would function as a mere “pass-through” entity. The scheme operated as follows: Kousisis arranged for Alpha’s actual paint suppliers, with whom he negotiated directly, to “generate purchase orders . . . billed to Markias.” Id., at 193. When Markias received an invoice, it tacked on a few-percent fee and then forwarded the inflated invoice to Kousisis. He, in turn, issued two checks: one paid Markias for its mark up, and the other covered the actual cost of the supplies. In short, Markias was no more than a paper pusher, funneling checks and invoices to and from Alpha’s actual suppliers. Not only did this arrangement contradict Kousisis’s prior representations, it also contravened DOT’s rule that a contributing disadvantaged business must “perfor[m] a commercially useful function.” §26.55(c).1
 Kousisis’s scheme initially went undetected. As the projects progressed, he falsely reported qualifying payments to Markias. PennDOT, satisfied with Alpha’s paint and repair work, paid it accordingly. By the time the last coat of paint  had dried, Alpha had turned a gross profit of over $20 million. And Markias, for its “pass-through” services, had pocketed a total of about $170,000.
 Once the deception came to light, a grand jury indicted Alpha and Kousisis for wire fraud and conspiracy to commit the same. See 18 U. S. C. §§1343, 1349. After a trial, the jury found them guilty of three counts of wire fraud and one count of conspiracy. Alpha and Kousisis moved for a judgment of acquittal, arguing that because their paintwork met PennDOT’s expectations, PennDOT had received the full economic benefit of its bargain. Thus, notwithstanding the lack of disadvantaged-business participation, the Government could not prove that they had schemed to defraud PennDOT of “money or property” as the federal wire fraud statute requires. §1343.
 The District Court rejected this argument, and the Third Circuit affirmed the convictions. As both courts explained, “obtaining the [G]overnment’s money or property was precisely the object” of Alpha and Kousisis’s “fraudulent scheme.” 82 F. 4th 230, 240 (2023); see also 2019 WL 4126484, *13 (ED Pa., June 17, 2019) (“[T]he scheme targeted PennDOT’s money, because the agency paid for services—construction performed with materials supplied by a [disadvantaged business]—which it did not receive”). “Put simply,” Alpha and Kousisis “set out to obtain millions of dollars that they would not have received but for their fraudulent misrepresentations.” 82 F. 4th, at 240.
 The circuits are divided over the validity of a federal fraud conviction when the defendant did not seek to cause the victim net pecuniary loss. Several circuits, now including the Third, hold that such convictions may stand. See, e.g., id., at 240–244; United States v. Leahy, 464 F. 3d 773, 787–789 (CA7 2006); United States v. Granberry, 908 F. 2d 278, 280 (CA8 1990); United States v. Richter, 796 F. 3d 1173, 1192 (CA10 2015). Others disagree. See, e.g., United States v. Shellef, 507 F. 3d 82, 108–109 (CA2 2007); United States v. Sadlar, 750 F. 3d 585, 590–592 (CA6 2014); United States v. Bruchhausen, 977 F. 2d 464, 467–468 (CA9 1992); United States v. Takhalov, 827 F. 3d 1307, 1312–1314 (CA11 2016); United States v. Guertin, 67 F. 4th 445, 450–452 (CADC 2023). We granted certiorari to resolve the split. 602 U. S. ___ (2024).
II
 To convict Alpha and Kousisis, the Government needed to prove that they used the wires to execute a “scheme or artifice to defraud, or for obtaining money or property by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations, or promises.” 18 U. S. C. §1343. Despite the use of the disjunctive “or,” we have declined to interpret §1343 as establishing alternative pathways to a conviction. Instead, reading the two clauses together, we have held that “the money-or-property requirement of the latter phrase” operates as a limitation on the former. McNally v. United States, 483 U. S. 350, 358–360 (1987).2 A defendant commits federal wire fraud, in other words, only if he both “ ‘engaged in deception’ ” and had “ ‘money or property’ ” as “ ‘an object’ ” of his fraud. Ciminelli, 598 U. S., at 312 (quoting Kelly v. United States, 590 U. S. 391, 398 (2020)).
 The money-or-property requirement lies at the heart of this dispute. Although the lower courts once interpreted the phrase “money or property” as something of a catchall, we recently reiterated that the federal fraud statutes reach only “traditional property interests.” Ciminelli, 598 U. S., at 316. Schemes that target the exercise of the Government’s regulatory power, for example, do not count. See Kelly, 590 U. S., at 400; see also Cleveland v. United States, 531 U. S. 12, 23–24 (2000). Nor do schemes that seek to  deprive another of “intangible interests unconnected to property.” Ciminelli, 598 U. S., at 315; see also McNally, 483 U. S., at 356.3 And in all cases, because money or property must be an object of the defendant’s fraud, the traditional property interest at issue “must play more than some bit part in a scheme.” Kelly, 590 U. S., at 402. Obtaining the victim’s money or property must have been the “aim,” not an “incidental byproduct,” of the defendant’s fraud. Id., at 402, 404.
 From these rules, Alpha and Kousisis attempt to glean another: A federal fraud conviction cannot stand, they argue, unless the defendant sought to hurt the victim’s bottom line. Brief for Petitioners 2; Reply Brief 8. Yet the theory under which petitioners were prosecuted—what they call the fraudulent-inducement theory—is devoid of an  economic-loss requirement. As both parties describe it, the theory supports liability for federal fraud anytime a defendant “ ‘us[es] falsehoods to induce a victim to enter into a transaction.’ ” Brief for Petitioners 29 (quoting Brief in Opposition 9). In these situations, the defendant need not—and given the reciprocal nature of most transactions, often will not—aim to inflict economic loss. Because Alpha and Kousisis did not aim to do so here, they contend that their convictions are invalid.
 We are not convinced. The fraudulent-inducement theory is consistent with both the text of the wire fraud statute and our precedent interpreting it. We therefore reject petitioners’ proposed economic-loss requirement.
 A
1
 Start with the statute. To be guilty of wire fraud, a defendant must (1) “devis[e]” or “inten[d] to devise” a scheme (2) to “obtai[n] money or property” (3) “by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations, or promises.” §1343. The prototypical fraudulent-inducement scheme plainly satisfies each of these statutory elements. Under the theory, a defendant (1) “devise[s]” a “scheme” (2) to induce the victim into a contract to “obtai[n]” her “money or property” (3) “by means of false or fraudulent pretenses.” No matter how long we stare at it, the broad, generic language of §1343 leaves us struggling to see any basis for excluding a fraudulent-inducement scheme.
 Take the facts of this very case. By using Markias as a pass-through entity, petitioners “devised” a “scheme” to obtain contracts through feigned compliance with PennDOT’s disadvantaged-business requirement. Ibid. Their goal? To “obtai[n] money” (tens of millions of dollars) from PennDOT. Ibid. And how? By making a number of “false or fraudulent . . . representations”—first about their plans to obtain paint supplies from Markias and later about having done exactly that. Ibid. Section 1343 requires nothing more.
 Alpha and Kousisis’s contrary view rests on the premise that a scheme cannot constitute wire fraud if, as here, the defendant provides something—be it money, property, or services—of equal value in return. But the statute says otherwise. To “obtain” something means “to gain or attain possession” of it, usually “by some planned action or method.” Webster’s Third International Dictionary 1559 (2002). A thing is no less “obtained” simply because something else is simultaneously given in return. An art collector who acquires a rare sculpture can rightfully say that she “obtained” it, notwithstanding the six-figure price tag. And because the meaning of “obtain” does not turn on the value of  the exchanged items, the art collector can still say that she “obtained” the sculpture even if it was not objectively worth the price she paid.
 In short, the wire fraud statute is agnostic about economic loss. The statute does not so much as mention loss, let alone require it. Instead, a defendant violates §1343 by scheming to “obtain” the victim’s “money or property,” regardless of whether he seeks to leave the victim economically worse off. A conviction premised on a fraudulent inducement thus comports with §1343.
2
 Resisting this conclusion, Alpha and Kousisis assert that economic loss is part and parcel of the common-law understanding of fraud, a term that appears in two forms in the wire fraud statute. §1343 (a “scheme or artifice to defraud . . . by means of false or fraudulent pretenses” (emphasis added)). When Congress uses a term with origins in the common law, we generally presume that the term “ ‘brings the old soil with it.’ ” Sekhar v. United States, 570 U. S. 729, 733 (2013). As petitioners note, we have long interpreted the statutory term “fraud” (and its variations) this way—that is, by reference to its common-law pedigree. See Neder v. United States, 527 U. S. 1, 21–22 (1999); Universal Health Services, Inc. v. United States ex rel. Escobar, 579 U. S. 176, 187 (2016) (“[T]he term ‘fraudulent’ is a paradigmatic example of a statutory term that incorporates the common-law meaning of fraud”).
 This old-soil principle applies, however, only to the extent that a common-law term has “ ‘accumulated [a] settled meaning.’ ” Neder, 527 U. S., at 21; Kemp v. United States, 596 U. S. 528, 539 (2022). So to show that economic loss is necessary to securing a federal fraud conviction, Alpha and Kousisis must show that such loss was “widely accepted” as a component of common-law fraud. Morissette v. United States, 342 U. S. 246, 263 (1952). They cannot.
  At common law, “fraud” was a term with expansive reach. Rather than settle on a single form of liability, courts recognized at least three, and the particular elements and remedies turned on the nature of the plaintiff ’s alleged injury.
 To appreciate how the three forms differed, it may help to consider a variation of the facts here. Imagine that PennDOT discovered petitioners’ scheme soon after Alpha and Kousisis had begun work on the Girard Point and 30th Street projects. In such a circumstance, law and equity provided at least three avenues for relief: PennDOT could (1) seek to rescind the contracts; (2) refer the matter for indictment under the crime of false pretenses; or (3) bring a tort action against the fraudsters for the damages incurred.
 If PennDOT had wanted to rescind the fraud-infected contracts, most courts would historically have permitted it to do so even without a showing of economic loss. To obtain a rescission, PennDOT would have needed to establish only that it had “received property of a different character or condition than [it] was promised” (“although of equal value”) or, more relevant here, that the transaction had “prove[d] to be less advantageous than as represented” (“although there [was] no actual loss”). W. Keeton, D. Dobbs, R. Keeton, & D. Owen, Prosser and Keeton on Law of Torts §110, p. 766 (5th ed. 1984) (Prosser & Keeton). Put differently, many courts would have awarded the equitable remedy of rescission simply because Alpha and Kousisis had tricked PennDOT into a bargain materially different from the one they had promised. See Hirschman v. Healy, 162 Minn. 328, 331, 202 N. W. 734, 735 (1925) (“[I]t is to be noted that it was not indispensable to prove damages in dollars and cents to have cancellation or rescission of the contract and note for misrepresentations”); Williams v. Kerr, 152 Pa. 560, 565, 25 A. 618, 619 (1893); Spreckels v. Gorrill, 152 Cal. 383, 391, 92 P. 1011, 1015 (1907). To borrow a summary from Black (of Black’s Law Dictionary fame)  many “decisions repudiate[d] altogether [a] rule requiring a showing of actual damage.” 1 H. Black, Rescission of Contracts and Cancellation of Written Instruments §112, p. 314 (1916).4
 The same no-loss-required rule applied with equal force to the crime of false pretenses. As many courts held, the crime “was complete when the property was fraudulently obtained.” West v. State, 63 Neb. 257, 259, 88 N. W. 503, 504 (1901); see also Commonwealth v. Coe, 115 Mass. 481, 502–503 (1874); People v. Bryant, 119 Cal. 595, 597, 51 P. 960, 961 (1898); Commonwealth v. Ferguson, 135 Ky. 32, 34, 121 S. W. 967, 968 (1909); F. Byrne, False Pretenses and Cheats §II(7), in 12 American and English Encyclopaedia of Law 835 (D. Garland, L. McGehee, & J. Cockcroft eds., 2d ed. 1899). And because “actual loss” need not “follow[,] . . . it [was] immaterial that goods given in an exchange secured by false pretenses were equal in value to those obtained.” 1 E. McClain, Criminal Law §680, p. 686 (1897). Thus, if someone purchased “a picture upon the assertion untruly made that it was from the brush of some distinguished painter,” the fact that “the picture was of value” would not relieve the seller of “the criminality of the false pretense.” Bartlett v. State, 28 Ohio St. 669, 672 (1876). In such a case, the plaintiff had been “actually defrauded” even though she had not “suffered actual pecuniary loss.” In re Rudebeck, 95 Wash. 433, 440, 163 P. 930, 933 (1917).
 The Maine Supreme Court’s decision in State v. Mills is illustrative. 17 Me. 211 (1840). There, a horse owner represented to a potential buyer that the horse “was called the Charley,” even though “he knew that it was not the horse  called by that name.” Ibid. (syllabus). Persuaded, the buyer exchanged his “colt and five dollars in money” for the horse. Ibid. But as the buyer soon learned, the horse was not “the Charley,” though the seller claimed that it “was as good a horse” and “of equal or greater value” than the colt and money. Id., at 212. The court, overruling the defendant’s objections to the guilty verdict, explained that the facts constituted “a case literally within” the false- pretenses statute. Id., at 218 (majority opinion). Obtaining a conviction on false pretenses required proving simply “that one of the pretences [sic] was false, and that the injured party was induced thereby to part with his property.” Id., at 217.
 Treating Mills as an outlier, Alpha and Kousisis argue that common-law courts generally refused to entertain an action for fraud if the victim had not been injured. In one sense, they are correct: We have said that a fraud occurs only when the victim “has been actually misled to his injury.” Smith v. Richards, 13 Pet. 26, 39 (1839); see also Clarke v. White, 12 Pet. 178, 196 (1838) (“[A] mere fraudulent intent, unaccompanied by any injurious act, is not the subject of judicial cognizance” (emphasis added)). But petitioners beg the question by assuming that economic loss alone could satisfy this common-law “injury” requirement. As the cases and treatises discussed above confirm, it was the deception-induced deprivation of property—not economic loss—that common-law courts generally deemed injurious.5 See Stillwell v. Rankin, 55 Mont. 130, 135, 174 P.  186, 187 (1918) (Courts “do not concern themselves with wrongs which do not produce injury; but ‘injury’ and ‘pecuniary loss’ are not synonymous terms”). Thus, Mills is no outlier.
 That said, a different rule applied to the tort of deceit. To have a complete cause of action, the plaintiff must have “suffered substantial damage”; in other words, economic loss. Prosser & Keeton §110, at 765; see Butler v. Watkins, 13 Wall. 456, 464 (1872); Dura Pharmaceuticals, Inc. v. Broudo, 544 U. S. 336, 343–344 (2005) (The common-law deceit action required a plaintiff to show “that he suffered actual economic loss”). So, returning to the modified facts introduced above, PennDOT could not have brought a tort claim for deceit unless Alpha and Kousisis’s scheme had caused it economic loss. (Maybe PennDOT had passed over a less costly bid, for example, or restarted the bidding process at significant expense.)
 Regardless, cases involving deceit are largely inapposite to the question presented here. Courts required economic loss not because it was inherent to the common-law understanding of fraud, but because a tort action for deceit  “sound[ed] in damage” and thus was designed to compensate a plaintiff for her economic loss. United States v. Dunn, 268 U. S. 121, 131 (1925); see G. McCleary, Damage as Requisite to Rescission for Misrepresentation, 36 Mich. L. Rev. 1, 17 (1937) (describing rescission and damages as “two entirely different approaches to the problem of relief for misrepresentation”). So it is no surprise that courts required deceit victims to “prove damage to establish a right to recover.” Dunn, 268 U. S., at 131.
 To summarize, then, common-law courts did not uniformly condition an action sounding in fraud on the plaintiff ’s ability to prove economic loss. More specifically, if the action was one for rescission or a prosecution for false pretenses, the plaintiff ’s required “injury” ordinarily need not be financial. That sounds the death knell for Alpha and Kousisis’s reliance on the common law. The old-soil principle does not apply in the absence of a well-settled rule. Kemp, 596 U. S., at 539. In Pasquantino v. United States, for example, we refused to read “the wire fraud statute to except frauds directed at evading foreign taxes” because the relevant common-law rule did not “clearly ba[r] such a prosecution.” 544 U. S. 349, 359–360 (2005). So too here: The common law did not establish a generally applicable rule that all fraud plaintiffs must plead and prove economic loss, so we will not read such a requirement into the wire fraud statute.6 See id., at 364.

 Even Alpha and Kousisis concede that the common law did not require economic loss in every case. As they acknowledge, if a plaintiff was “delivered something different from what was promised”—even something of equivalent value—or if the bargain “involv[ed] an item with unique qualities,” then “failing to deliver as promised might constitute property fraud.” Reply Brief 15. When pressed at oral argument, petitioners referred to these scenarios as “the exception.” Tr. of Oral Arg. 10. But a few examples reveal just how easily such an “exception” swallows the rule. If someone contracts for a painting of her grandfather and instead winds up with a portrait of Grover Cleveland, petitioners’ so-called “exception” concededly applies. Id., at 9–11. So too if a supplier promises “apples” but instead delivers “oranges.” Reply Brief 15. But if these two examples fit the exception, why not a heap of coal worth a million dollars instead of a gold bar worth the same? Tr. of Oral Arg. 28–30. Or, more to the point, why not services performed with materials from a non-disadvantaged supplier when the government demanded a disadvantaged one? Petitioners offer no principled way to draw the line.
 And there is none, because at the right level of specificity, anything can be described as “unique” or “different from” something else. After all, “animal,” “horse,” “sound horse,” and “the horse called the Charley” are all accurate descriptions of the bargained-for property in Mills. 17 Me., at 212, 216. Only the most specific of those descriptions, “the horse  called the Charley,” distinguishes the property promised from the property received, yet the court still had no trouble labeling the case as one of “false pretence [sic], fraudulently made.” Id., at 218.
 Tellingly, Alpha and Kousisis identify no source of authority that supports treating uniqueness as some kind of exception to the no-loss-required rule. That is probably because the common law has long embraced a different standard—namely, materiality—as the principled basis for distinguishing everyday misstatements from actionable fraud. Whether in tort or contract law, “materiality look[s] to the effect on the likely or actual behavior of the recipient of the alleged misrepresentation.” Universal Health Services, 579 U. S., at 193 (internal quotation marks omitted; alteration in original). Resembling a but-for standard, materiality asks whether the misrepresentation “constitut[ed] an inducement or motive” to enter into a transaction. Smith, 13 Pet., at 39. Or, as we explained in Universal Health Services, a misrepresentation is material if a reasonable person would attach importance to it in deciding how to proceed, or if the defendant knew (or should have known) that the recipient would likely deem it important. 579 U. S., at 193 (citing Restatement (Second) of Torts §538 (1976); Restatement (Second) of Contracts §162(2) (1979)).7
 Before us, the parties debate the details of the materiality standard for purposes of §1343. For their part, Alpha and Kousisis direct us to the common-law test just described—what they call “the traditional materiality test.” Reply  Brief 18–21. The Government, by contrast, proposes an  essence-of-the-bargain test, under which a misrepresentation is material only if it goes “ ‘to the very essence’ ” of the parties’ “ ‘bargain.’ ” Universal Health Services, 579 U. S., at 194, n. 5 (quoting Junius Constr. Corp. v. Cohen, 257 N. Y. 393, 400, 178 N. E. 672, 674 (1931)); see Brief for United States 43–45. We need not settle the debate here, however, because Alpha and Kousisis have not contested that their misrepresentations were material. For now, it is enough to reiterate “that materiality of falsehood is an  element of ”—and thus a limit on—the federal fraud statutes. Neder, 527 U. S., at 25. A conviction premised on the fraudulent-inducement theory cannot be sustained without it.
B
 Petitioners insist that our precedent forecloses the  fraudulent-inducement theory, but they are wrong: We have twice rejected the argument that a fraud conviction depends on economic loss. We did so first in Carpenter v. United States, a case in which the defendants had repeatedly leaked the contents of a newspaper’s investment column. 484 U. S. 19, 23 (1987). Although the scheme did not cause the newspaper “monetary loss,” it was sufficient, we held, that the newspaper “ha[d] been deprived of its right to exclusive use” of its proprietary information. Id., at 26. Then, in Shaw v. United States, we affirmed a conviction under the bank fraud statute even though “no bank involved in the scheme” had “suffered any monetary loss.” 580 U. S. 63, 67 (2016). The statute, we explained, “demands neither a showing of ultimate financial loss nor a showing of intent to cause financial loss.” Ibid.
 Still, Alpha and Kousisis contend that the fraudulent- inducement theory is at odds with other aspects of our precedent. First, they argue that it permits a fraud conviction premised on mere interference with “the State’s ‘sovereign  power to regulate.’ ” Kelly, 590 U. S., at 401 (quoting Cleveland, 531 U. S., at 23). Not so. No matter the underlying theory of fraud, §1343 requires that “money or property” have been an object of the fraudster’s scheme. See 590 U. S., at 393. So if the scheme is one to alter the exercise of regulatory power—say, by tricking the Government into handing over a gaming license—the fraudulent-inducement theory has no role to play. See Cleveland, 531 U. S., at 23–24. But if, as here, the fraudster seeks to induce the Government into a transfer of its money or property, that loss is sufficient to sustain a fraud conviction. The loss is not, as petitioners argue, a mere “incidental byproduct” of a scheme to manipulate the exercise of regulatory power. Kelly, 590 U. S., at 403. If anything, the inverse is typically true: In the mine run of fraudulent-inducement schemes, undermining the Government’s regulatory interests is merely “an incidental (even if foreseen) byproduct” of obtaining its money or property. See ibid. Here, for example, Alpha and Kousisis had money in mind. Nothing suggests that they concocted their scheme with the goal of thwarting PennDOT’s disadvantaged-business initiative. Such a result was downstream of their “object” to line their pockets. Ibid.; see also 82 F. 4th, at 240.
 The money-or-property requirement also explains why the fraudulent-inducement theory does not, as petitioners maintain, “collapse Congress’s distinction” between the wire fraud statute and the statutes that prohibit conspiracies to defraud the United States, see 18 U. S. C. §371, and false or fraudulent statements in federal matters, see §1001. Brief for Petitioners 27. Because these latter statutes are not limited to schemes to “obtai[n] money or property,” they extend beyond what the fraudulent-inducement theory can reach. §1343. See United States v. Ressam, 553 U. S. 272, 274 (2008) (describing a conviction under §1001 for making “false statements to a customs official” to obtain entry into the United States). Thus, fraudulent inducement  cannot convert every lie punishable under §371 and §1001 into a fraud offense subject to a possible 20-year sentence.
 Nor does the theory undermine our precedent holding that—aside from the honest-services exception—§1343 does not “protect intangible interests unconnected to traditional property rights.” Ciminelli, 598 U. S., at 312. As already discussed, a defendant commits wire fraud only if his scheme “aimed to deprive” the victim of a traditional property interest. Kelly, 590 U. S., at 400; see also Ciminelli, 598 U. S., at 309. If the scheme instead targeted some kind of intangible interest—for example, a citizen’s interest in “impartial government”—the fraudulent-inducement theory is inapplicable. McNally, 483 U. S., at 355.
 Finally, the fraudulent-inducement theory is not a “repackag[ing]” of the right-to-control theory. Reply Brief 11. In Ciminelli, we rejected the latter theory, which maintains that the term “ ‘property’ in §1343” includes “ ‘the right to control the use of one’s assets.’ ” 598 U. S., at 311. According to this strained definition of “property,” a defendant violates §1343 simply by “schem[ing] to deprive a victim of potentially valuable economic information necessary to make discretionary economic decisions.” Id., at 310. Such a scheme, we held, does not implicate any “traditional property interes[t].” Id., at 316.
 Unlike the right-to-control theory, fraudulent inducement does not treat “mere information as the protected interest.” Id., at 315. Rather, it protects money and property. And nothing we said in Ciminelli is at odds with our holding here. Although the Government urged us to affirm Ciminelli’s conviction on an alternative ground—namely, the fraudulent-inducement theory—we declined to do so because it would have required us “to assume not only the function of a court of first view, but also of a jury.” Id., at 317. We did not discuss, much less reject, the fraudulent-inducement theory. See id., at 317–318 (ALITO, J., concur ring) (observing that the Court had not addressed “the Government’s ability to retry petitioner” on this theory).
III
 Alpha and Kousisis warn of the consequences that will ensue if we endorse the fraudulent-inducement theory. “Under the theory,” they say, “every intentional misrepresentation designed to induce someone to transact in property would constitute property fraud.” Brief for Petitioners 40. In their view, this result threatens fair notice and, by encroaching into States’ police powers, runs headlong into principles of federalism. Id., at 38–39.
 We are not persuaded. The “demanding” materiality requirement substantially narrows the universe of actionable misrepresentations. Universal Health Services, 579 U. S., at 194. And the boundaries of the fraudulent-inducement theory are not so imprecise as to risk encroachment on States’ authority or to “create traps” for the “unwary.” Snyder v. United States, 603 U. S. 1, 15 (2024). Rather, the theory criminalizes a particular species of fraud: intentionally lying to induce a victim into a transaction that will cost her money or property. As Judge Learned Hand put it, “[a] man is none the less cheated out of his property, when he is induced to part with it by fraud, because he gets a quid pro quo of equal value.” United States v. Rowe, 56 F. 2d 747, 749 (CA2 1932).
 The “language of the wire fraud statute” is undeniably “broad.” Pasquantino, 544 U. S., at 372. But Congress enacted the wire fraud statute, and it is up to Congress—if it so chooses—to change it.
*  *  *
 Fraudulent inducement “has long been considered a species of actionable fraud.” United States v. Feldman, 931 F. 3d 1245, 1270 (CA11 2019) (Pryor, J., concurring). Because the Third Circuit’s judgment comports with §1343,  we affirm it.
It is so ordered.

Notes
1  At least on these facts, DOT left no room for ambiguity: A disadvantaged business “does not perform a commercially useful function if its role is limited to that of an extra participant in a transaction, contract, or project through which funds are passed to obtain the appearance” of disadvantaged-business “participation.” §26.55(c)(2).
2  Although McNally involved the mail fraud statute, §1341, “ ‘we have construed identical language in the wire and mail fraud statutes in pari materia.’ ” Ciminelli v. United States, 598 U. S. 306, 312, n. 2 (2023); see Kelly v. United States, 590 U. S. 391, 398 (2020).
3  Responding to our decision in McNally, Congress amended the statute to include schemes that seek to “deprive another of the intangible right of honest services.” §1346; see also Cleveland, 531 U. S., at 19–20 (describing this history). That exception is irrelevant here.
4  To be sure, some courts saw things differently. See 1 Black, Rescission of Contracts §112, at 312–313. But because Alpha and Kousisis must show that an economic-loss requirement “was ‘well-settled’ before the transplantation” of the term “fraud” into §1343, any divergence among courts further confirms that the old-soil principle does not apply. Kemp v. United States, 596 U. S. 528, 539 (2022).
5  JUSTICE GORSUCH understands us to have “spurn[ed] fraud’s historic injury rule.” Post, at 2 (opinion concurring in part and concurring in judgment). Respectfully, he is mistaken. All agree that “at common law, fraud required proof that the victim was injured.” Ibid. But as the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania put it in Williams v. Kerr, an “injury” has occurred when a fraudster “obtain[s] from an owner, by a false representation of a fact which he deems material, property which he would not otherwise have parted with upon the terms which he is thus induced to accept.” 152 Pa. 560, 565, 25 A. 618, 619 (1893); see also MacLaren v. Cochran, 44 Minn. 255, 258, 46 N. W. 408, 410 (1890) (“If a party is induced to enter into a contract by fraudulent representations as to a fact which he deems material, and upon which he has a right to rely, . . . the party in the wrong should not be heard to say that no real injury can result from the fact misrepresented”); Carlisle v. State, 76 Ala. 75, 77 (1884) (“The only injury that can be inflicted, ‘by any false pretense or token,’ by which one person ‘obtains from another any money or other personal property,’ is the deception which imposes on the confidence of that other”); 1 E. McClain, Criminal Law §680, p. 686 (1897) (“It is the obtaining of the money or property that is the perpetration of the fraud”). And in no sense is our recognition of this common-law definition mere “dicta.” Post, at 10 (opinion of GORSUCH, J.). Rather, it is essential to our holding. To reject that pecuniary loss is an element of fraud is to accept—as common-law courts long have—that a fraud is complete when the defendant has induced the deprivation of money or property under materially false pretenses.
6  JUSTICE GORSUCH’s proposed injury requirement suffers from much the same problem. He relies primarily on cases that involve other elements of common-law fraud—namely, falsity and intent to defraud. See post, at 4 (opinion concurring in part and concurring in judgment) (citing State v. Casperson, 71 Utah 68, 75, 262 P. 294, 296 (1927) (falsity); State v. Asher, 50 Ark. 427, 430–431, 8 S. W. 177, 178 (1888) (falsity); Rex v. Williams, 7 Car. & P. 354, 173 Eng. Rep. 158 (N. P. 1836) (Coleridge, J.) (intent to defraud); People v. Baker, 96 N. Y. 340, 347–348 (1884) (intent to defraud); People v. Wakely, 62 Mich. 297, 300–303, 28 N. W. 871, 872–873 (1886) (both)). And as for State v. Palmer, 50 Kan. 318, 32 P. 29 (1893), even the Kansas Supreme Court has said that it “did not define ‘injury.’ ” State v. Schultz, 252 Kan. 819, 848, 850 P. 2d 818, 837 (1993). JUSTICE GORSUCH also points to a series of cases from the courts of appeals. See post, at 5 (opinion concurring in part and concurring in judgment). But because these cases postdate the enactment of the wire fraud statute (many by several decades), any rule they articulate—even assuming it is a coherent one—cannot possibly satisfy the old-soil principle. Thus, JUSTICE GORSUCH’s injury requirement rests not on “ ‘well-settled’ ” soil, but on shifting sands. Kemp, 596 U. S., at 539.
7  While JUSTICE GORSUCH is right to note that assessing whether a misrepresentation is material “will not always be simple,” post, at 9 (opinion concurring in part and concurring in judgment), he overlooks that “materiality is judged according to an objective standard,” Amgen Inc. v. Connecticut Retirement Plans and Trust Funds, 568 U. S. 455, 459 (2013). That is not true of his proposed injury requirement. As “the horse called the Charley” example illustrates, whether a victim “ ‘got exactly what he paid for’ ” will often lie in the eye of the beholder. Post, at 6 (opinion of GORSUCH, J.) (emphasis added).

STAMATIOS KOUSISIS, ET AL., PETITIONERS v. UNITED STATES
on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the third circuit
________________________________________
[May 22, 2025]
________________________________________
 JUSTICE THOMAS, concurring.
 Petitioners Stamatios Kousisis and Alpha Painting and Construction Co., Inc., ask the Court to add an economic-loss requirement to the federal wire-fraud statute, 18 U. S. C. §1343. The Court correctly rejects that request, and I join its opinion in full.
 I write separately to address an issue that the Court reserves: whether petitioners’ misstatements were “material,” and thus actionable, under §1343. When the Government prosecutes a defendant for wire fraud under a theory of fraudulent inducement, the requirement of “materiality” provides “the principled basis for distinguishing everyday misstatements from actionable fraud.” Ante, at 15. Because petitioners “have not contested that their misrepresentations were material,” the Court has no occasion to pass on that issue today. Ante, at 16. But, I am skeptical that petitioners’ misrepresentations were material.
I
 Petitioners entered into contracts with the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation (PennDOT) for the restoration of two Philadelphia properties, the Girard Point Bridge and the 30th Street Station. The purpose of the Girard Point Bridge contract was the “preservation of the Girard Point Bridge.” App. 108. The 30th Street Station contract  had a similar goal: the “[r]ehabilitation of bridges.” Id., at 169. To achieve these goals, the contracts required painting, structural steel repairs, roadway reconstruction, and other miscellaneous construction projects.
 The contracts for these two jobs totaled more than a thousand pages and imposed numerous regulatory, technical, and ethical obligations. Among other things, the agreements required petitioners to abide by the Workmen’s Compensation Act of 1915; to follow specific “Buy America Provisions” that required petitioners to use steel and iron manufactured in the United States; to generally avoid using “materials produced by convict labor”; and to “not discriminate on the basis of race, color, national origin or sex.” See, e.g., App. 112, 114, 117–119, 173, 175.
 The contracts also required petitioners to “carry out applicable requirements of 49 C.F.R. Part 26,” id., at 114, 175 (emphasis deleted), which implements the Federal Government’s Disadvantaged Business Enterprise (DBE) program. The DBE program is the Government’s “most far-reaching federal status-based contracting program.” D. Bernstein, The Modern American Law of Race, 94 S. Cal. L. Rev. 171, 208 (2021) (Bernstein). Established in 1983, it sets a goal that at least 10 percent of federal funds authorized for any highway and transit program “be expended with small business concerns owned and controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals.” Surface Transportation Assistance Act of 1982, 96 Stat. 2100. Under Department of Transportation (DOT) regulations, a small business qualifies as a so-called DBE if it is “at least 51 percent owned by one or more individuals who are both socially and economically disadvantaged,” and managed and controlled “by one or more of the socially and economically disadvantaged individuals who own it.” 49 CFR §26.5 (2024).
 DOT defines the term “socially and economically disad vantaged” primarily on the basis of race and sex. The program “rebuttably presume[s]” that any member of certain enumerated races “has been subjected to racial or ethnic prejudice or cultural bias within American society because of his or her identity as a member of a group,” and thus qualifies as a “socially and economically disadvantaged individual.” Ibid. Among the groups presumptively eligible for DBE benefits are “ ‘Black Americans,’ ” “ ‘Hispanic Americans,’ ” “ ‘Native Americans,’ ” “ ‘Asian-Pacific Americans,’ ” and “ ‘Subcontinent Asian Americans.’ ” Ibid. The DBE program also provides this favorable presumption to women. Ibid. DBE certifiers “may not question claims of group membership as a matter of course.” §26.67(a)(3). Thus, “[i]n practice, being certified as a ‘minority’ to get presumptive status as the owner of a disadvantaged business eligible for preferences primarily operates on the honor code, as the information is rarely verified.” Bernstein 223.
 While those excluded from DOT’s list of presumptively disadvantaged groups may “attempt to prove” sufficient disadvantage, §26.67(d)(1), the application process is “a high hurdle,” Mid-America Milling Co., LLC v. United States Dept. of Transp., 2024 WL 4267183, *9 (ED Ky., Sept. 23, 2024). For example, “[a] White male claiming to have experienced employment discrimination” must submit a detailed “Personal Narrative” providing evidence that “his employment status and/or limited opportunities to earn income result from specific prejudicial acts directed at him personally because of an [objective distinguishing feature].” §26.67(d).
 PennDOT incorporated DBE goals into both contracts at issue in this case, and, as the majority explains, petitioners misrepresented their compliance with those provisions. See ante, at 3. The Government prosecuted petitioners under 18 U. S. C. §1343, alleging fraudulent inducement. Ante, at 1. The jury convicted, and petitioner Kousisis was sentenced to nearly six years in prison.
 II
 Although the Court leaves the question of materiality for another day because it was uncontested here, ante, at 15–16, materiality is an element that the Government must satisfy in any federal wire-fraud prosecution. See Neder v. United States, 527 U. S. 1, 25 (1999). The Government argues that the standard for materiality in this context is the one this Court articulated in Universal Health Services, Inc. v. United States ex rel. Escobar, 579 U. S. 176 (2016)—whether a misrepresentation went to the very “ ‘essence of the bargain,’ ” Brief for United States 43 (quoting Universal Health Services, 579 U. S., at 194, n. 5). I seriously doubt that the DBE provisions can meet this standard.
A
 Universal Health Services presented the question whether “a defendant should face False Claims Act liability only if it fails to disclose the violation of a contractual, statutory, or regulatory provision that the Government expressly designated a condition of payment.” Id., at 190. While we rejected that limitation, we stressed that “a misrepresentation about compliance with a statutory, regulatory, or contractual requirement must be material to the Government’s payment decision in order to be actionable” under the False Claims Act (FCA). Id., at 192.
 We further observed that, “[u]nder any understanding of the concept, materiality ‘look[s] to the effect on the likely or actual behavior of the recipient of the alleged misrepresentation.’ ” Id., at 193 (quoting 26 R. Lord, Williston on Contracts §69:12, p. 549 (4th ed. 2003) (Williston)). In contracting specifically, “ ‘[a] misrepresentation is material’ only if it would ‘likely . . . induce a reasonable person to manifest his assent,’ or the defendant ‘knows that for some special reason [the representation] is likely to induce the particular recipient to manifest his assent’ to the transaction.” 579 U. S., at 193 (quoting Restatement (Second) of Contracts  §162(2), and Comment c, pp. 439, 441 (1979)). Thus, we explained, for a contract term to be material, it must go to “ ‘the very essence of the bargain.’ ” 579 U. S., at 194, n. 5 (quoting Junius Constr. Co. v. Cohen, 257 N. Y. 393, 400, 178 N. E. 672, 674 (1931)); see also 23 Williston §63:3,  p. 483 (4th ed. 2018) (materiality “ ‘go[es] to the root’ ” of the parties’ agreement, and “touches the fundamental purpose of the contract”).
 This materiality inquiry does not rest solely on a contract’s labels. Even in the face of contrary contract language, materiality “cannot be found where noncompliance is minor or insubstantial.” Universal Health Services, 579 U. S., at 194. A party’s actions may reveal that a contract term is not material even if the contract’s language would suggest otherwise. For example, “if the Government regularly pays a particular type of claim in full despite actual knowledge that certain requirements were violated, and has signaled no change in its position, that is strong evidence that the requirements are not material.” Id., at 195.
 Applying these “familiar and rigorous” principles, ibid., n. 6, we made clear that regulatory requirements in a contract are not automatically material. We thus rejected the Government’s contention that, if it “contracts for health  services and adds a requirement that contractors buy American-made staplers, anyone who submits a claim for those services but fails to disclose its use of foreign staplers violates the False Claims Act.” Id., at 195–196. That logic would have meant that, “if the Government required contractors to aver their compliance with the entire U. S. Code and Code of Federal Regulations, . . . failing to mention noncompliance with any of those requirements would always be material.” Id., at 196. The FCA, we explained, “does not adopt such an extraordinarily expansive view of liability.” Ibid.1
  The Court reserved the question whether the standard for materiality in the FCA context is identical to the standard that applies to wire-fraud prosecutions, id., at 192–193, and I express no definitive view on that question here. But, the standard we articulated in Universal Health Services was a “familiar” one that aligned with authoritative treatises and the common law. Id., at 195, n. 6. And, particularly in light of the Government’s endorsement, see Brief for United States 43, it, at minimum, provides a useful baseline for evaluating the DBE provisions’ materiality.
B
 The contracts in this case were for bridge repairs, not minority hiring. There are several reasons to think that the DBE provisions did not go “ ‘to the very essence of the bargain.’ ” Universal Health Services, 579 U. S., at 194, n. 5.
 First, the DBE provisions were irrelevant to the contracts’ fundamental purpose—bridge repair—which suggests that they were the sort of “minor or insubstantial” conditions that cannot count as material. Id., at 194. As the Third Circuit recognized below, although petitioners  did not meet PennDOT’s DBE conditions, they “delivered the requested work, and the quality of the workmanship and materials [was] uncontested.” 82 F. 4th 230, 244 (2023).
 If the DBE conditions “ ‘went to the very essence of the [parties’] bargain,’ ” Universal Health Services, 579 U. S., at 194, n. 5, the failure to meet those conditions presumably would have had some impact on the final work product. Accord, e.g., Cohen, 257 N. Y., at 400, 178 N. E., at 674 (describing term that goes to an agreement’s “essence” as one which, if not met, would “destroy the [agreement’s] value”); 3511 13th St. Tenants’ Assn. v. 3511 13th St., N. W. Residences, LLC, 922 A. 2d 439, 445 (D. C. 2007) (“ ‘For a breach to be material, it must be so serious [as] to destroy the essential object of the agreement’ ”). But, the DBE conditions had no bearing on petitioners’ ability to complete their projects. See 82 F. 4th, at 244. That disconnect tends to support the conclusion that those requirements would not meet the “demanding” materiality standard this Court has articulated. Universal Health Services, 579 U. S., at 194; accord, e.g., Landmark Health Solutions, LLC v. Not For Profit Hospital Corp., 950 F. Supp. 2d 130, 137–138 (DC 2013) (“[C]ompl[iance] with the District’s requirement to be registered and to obtain a license” did not go to “the essential purpose” of a contract for “providing management consulting and staffing services”).
 Second, the DBE provisions appear to have been less important than contract terms going to the quality and timeliness of bridge repair, further indicating that the latter went to the essence of the parties’ bargain while the former did not. The contracts required PennDOT to deduct payments due petitioners if the “work . . . on th[e] project[s]” was late or unsatisfactory. App. 109, 170. While the contracts labeled the failure to comply with the DBE provisions “a material breach” that “may result in termination,” id., at  114, 175 (emphasis added), nothing in the contracts required PennDOT to take any action, let alone to withhold or deduct payment. Accord, Brief for United States 19 (DBE noncompliance “could have resulted in corrective action” (emphasis added)).
 As we explained in Universal Health Services, while “the Government’s decision to expressly identify a provision as a condition of payment” is not dispositive of materiality, it is still relevant evidence that tends to suggest that a particular term is material. 579 U. S., at 194. Tethering payment to workmanship and timeliness requirements suggests that the essence of the parties’ contracts was timely and satisfactory “work . . . on th[e] project[s]”—that is, “painting, structural steel repairs, expansion dam repairs, latex modified concrete overlay, and other miscellaneous construction,” or, more generally, the “[r]ehabilitation of bridges,” App. 108–109, 169–170. Read “with reference to the whole” contract, 11 Williston §32:5, p. 692 (4th ed. 2012), the comparative absence of any such express conditions for DBE noncompliance counsels against reading those provisions into the contract’s “fundamental purpose,” 23 id., §63:3, at 483.
 Third, we have explained that the Government’s decision to fulfill its end of a bargain “despite actual knowledge that certain requirements were violated” is very “strong evidence that those requirements are not material,” Universal Health Services, 579 U. S., at 195, and similar logic might apply where, as here, contract violations are notorious and widespread. No one contends that the Government had “actual knowledge” of petitioners’ fraud when it entered into the contracts. Ibid. But, if DBE fraud is so prevalent that the Government would have to assume a significant number of its contractors violate contract provisions requiring DBE compliance, that fact could cast further doubt on those provisions’ materiality.
 Reports of fraud in the Government’s small-business-  contracting programs have “emerge[d] with some regularity,” making fraud in these programs “a perennial concern for Congress and commentators.” Congressional Research Service, K. Manuel & E. Lunder, Federal Contracting and Subcontracting With Small Businesses: Issues in the 112th Congress 33 (2012). The DBE program is no exception: Fraudulent DBE schemes where minority and women contractors are used as “ ‘false front[s]’ ” is “an area with serious enforcement and compliance problems that appears to be nationwide in scope.” Oversight Hearing on the Elimination of Waste, Fraud, and Abuse in Mandatory Transportation Programs before the House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, 108th Cong., 1st Sess., 109 (2003) (Oversight Hearing). Legislators have long recognized that DBE fraud is a substantial problem, and that “people are just laughing about the system” and “gaming the system blatantly.” Id., at 38–39; see also id., at 36 (DOT Inspector General testifying that DBE fraud “is a serious problem”).
 Looking at materiality “from the viewpoint of the [allegedly misleading statement’s] maker,” Restatement (Second) of Contracts §162, Comment c, at 441, knowledge of rampant misrepresentations in the DBE program could suggest to a reasonable contractor that, contract language notwithstanding, the Government does not actually consider DBE compliance essential to its contracts. Pervasive fraud also suggests that the Government may be continuing performance on its contracts despite knowing that its counterparties frequently violate DBE requirements, further counseling against those terms’ materiality. See Universal Health Services, 579 U. S., at 193–194, n. 5, 195. 2
  Fourth, if complying with the DBE provisions would violate the law, it is difficult to see how representing such compliance “would be likely to induce a reasonable person to manifest his assent.” Restatement (Second) of Contracts §162, Comment c, at 441. Among other things, the DBE program imposes an explicitly race-based classification system, see supra, at 2–3, which warrants “the strictest judicial scrutiny,” Adarand Constructors, Inc. v. Peña, 515 U. S. 200, 224 (1995). Thus, for the program to survive, the Government would need to prove that it addresses “past governmental discrimination” that is “concrete and traceable to the de jure segregated system,” and that the segregated system has “discrete and continuing discriminatory effect.” Students for Fair Admissions, Inc. v. President and Fellows of Harvard College, 600 U. S. 181, 260 (2023) (THOMAS, J., concurring).
 I am skeptical that the Government could meet this high bar. While the Government has not been put to the test in this case, it appears to have elsewhere endorsed the DBE program’s race-based benefits on the ground that “minorities represent more than 20% of the population” yet “own only 9% of all construction firms and receive only about 5% of construction receipts.” Oversight Hearing, at 41. But, “ ‘[p]roving broad sociological propositions by statistics is a dubious business, and one that inevitably is in tension with the normative philosophy that underlies the Equal Protection Clause.’ ” Lamprecht v. FCC, 958 F. 2d 382, 398 (CADC 1992) (THOMAS, Cir. J., for the court) (quoting Craig v. Boren, 429 U. S. 190, 204 (1976)). And, at least one court has preliminarily enjoined the Government’s use of DBE goals because the Government could not “justify [the DBE program’s] discriminatory policies.” Mid-America Milling Co., 2024 WL 4267183, *11.
 It is implausible to think that a “ ‘reasonable person’ ” would “ ‘attach importance’ ” to contract provisions that mandate constitutional violations. Universal Health Services, 579 U. S., at 193, n. 5. The same intuition applies to Government actors. Cf. Postal Service v. Gregory, 534 U. S. 1, 10 (2001) (“[A] presumption of regularity attaches to the actions of Government agencies”). Thus, if the Government cannot demonstrate the constitutionality of the DBE program, I doubt that a provision requiring compliance with the program could go to the essence of the parties’ bargain—particularly here, given that the very same provisions requiring DBE compliance simultaneously prohibit “discriminat[ion] on the basis of race, color, national origin or sex.” App. 114, 175.3
 At bottom, the essence-of-the-bargain standard is rigorous and context specific. Although the contracts in this case used language suggesting the DBE provisions were material, see ibid., we have made clear that the materiality inquiry turns on substance rather than labels, see Universal Health Services, 579 U. S., at 190. That focus may doom the Government’s prosecutions in DBE cases where materiality is contested.
 *  *  *
 In persuading the Court to reject petitioners’ economic-loss arguments today, the Government has assured us that “the ‘essence of the bargain’ standard for materiality” will ensure that federal wire-fraud prosecutions cannot be used to target benign, everyday misstatements. Brief for United States 43. Because a demanding approach to materiality is all that prevents an “extraordinarily expansive view of liability” from rendering the federal wire-fraud statute nearly limitless in scope, Universal Health Services, 579 U. S., at 196, lower courts should hold the Government to its word.
________________________________________
Notes
1  In my view, the Court’s reluctance to presume the materiality of every contract provision is particularly appropriate in the context of Government contracting. The Government often tries to use monetary incentives to advance political objectives. For example, the Government sometimes seeks to use its spending power to “create incentives for States to act in accordance with federal policies.” National Federation of Independent Business v. Sebelius, 567 U. S. 519, 577 (2012) (plurality opinion). And, those policies may bear little relation to the expenditure of federal funds. See, e.g., South Dakota v. Dole, 483 U. S. 203, 218 (1987) (O’Connor, J., dissenting) (arguing that “a condition that a State will raise its drinking age to 21” exceeded the Government’s spending power because it could not “fairly be said to be reasonably related to the expenditure of funds for highway construction”). In Government contracting, the Government’s inclusion of political or regulatory requirements unrelated to the contracts’ core purpose might simply reflect the Government’s attempt to achieve policy goals by leveraging its unmatched bargaining position. The DBE provisions’ apparent irrelevance to bridge repair seems to fit this pattern. See infra this page and 7.
2  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR observes that “[n]o cited portion of the record” shows that PennDOT paid contracts in full despite actual knowledge that the DBE terms were being violated. Post, at 7 (opinion concurring in judgment). I have recognized as much, see supra, at 8, which is why I suggest that my materiality analysis might apply in different DBE-compliance prosecutions “where materiality is contested,” infra, at 11. For similar reasons, JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR’s critique of “reports from decades prior” misses the mark. Post, at 7. The reports and testimony I cite provide examples suggesting that, in other DBE-compliance prosecutions, defendants may be able to build records demonstrating that the Government pays contractors despite knowing that they do not comply with DBE provisions. JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR does not dispute that, if presented, such records would constitute “strong evidence that [DBE] requirements are not material.” Universal Health Services, 579 U. S., at 195.
3  “[A] claim of unconstitutionality” will not “excuse a voluntary, deliberate and calculated course of fraud and deceit,” Dennis v. United States, 384 U. S. 855, 867 (1966), but the question whether that unconstitutionality might contribute to materiality is distinct. No one disputes that petitioners did not “rais[e] a challenge to the DBE program’s constitutionality.” Post, at 8 (opinion of SOTOMAYOR, J.). But, had petitioners done so, they might have been able to rely on the DBE provisions’ unconstitutionality to support an argument that the provisions were not “material” to their contracts.

 JUSTICE GORSUCH, concurring in part and concurring in the judgment.
 This case touches on an old question: What is the difference between a lie and a criminal fraud? Consider an easy hypothetical. In a phone interview, a couple asks a prospective babysitter if she has a criminal record. The babysitter says no, but that’s not right. While she has sought to turn her life around, a burglary conviction lurks in her past, one she is too embarrassed to mention. Relying on her misrepresentation, the parents hire the babysitter. Her work proves exemplary and the couple pays her well. Later, though, the parents discover the babysitter’s lie. They might be upset and refuse to hire her again. But should the babysitter face federal fraud charges? Of course not. While “intentional deceit for purposes of gain ought sometimes to be punished,” if all misrepresentations amounted to criminal fraud, “thousands of buyers and sellers” would be felons. T. Macaulay, J. Macleod, G. Anderson, & F. Millet, Notes on the Indian Penal Code (1837), in 7 The Life and Works of Lord Macaulay 527–528 (1897).
 How do courts police the line between mere lies and criminal frauds warranting the law’s attention? One important tool is fraud’s injury requirement. To prove a criminal fraud, a prosecutor must show that the victim did not receive what the defendant promised. It is a rule that shields  people like our babysitter from the prosecutor’s sights. And it is a rule that keeps judges from becoming arbiters of good morals. A fraud conviction can mean years, even decades, in prison. Before a prosecutor may seek, and a court may authorize, that kind of punishment, the law demands more than a victimless lie.
 While right about much else, the Court’s decision today contains a footnote that appears to spurn fraud’s historic injury rule. Under the federal wire-fraud statute, the Court suggests, it does not matter if the putative victim receives all he was promised. So long as he parts with any money or property because of the defendant’s misrepresentation, the Court seems to say, that is injury enough to sustain a federal wire-fraud conviction. Ante, at 11, n. 5. It is a startling suggestion, one with no mooring in the common law of fraud or the wire-fraud statute, and one that risks turning victimless lies like our babysitter’s into federal felonies. Respectfully, that cannot be the law.
I
 The question presented in this case is a narrow one. The parties ask us to resolve whether the federal wire-fraud statute, 18 U. S. C. §1343, requires the government to plead and prove that the defendant caused his victim a “net pecuniary loss.” Brief for United States (I) (reciting the question presented); ante, at 1–2. Today, the Court holds that the answer is no. Congress, the Court explains, enacted the federal wire-fraud statute against the backdrop of the common law. Ante, at 8. And, at common law, fraud required proof that the victim was injured. Ante, at 11.1 But that  injury requirement never demanded proof that the victim suffered a “net pecuniary loss.” So, the Court concludes, neither does the federal wire-fraud statute. On each of those points, the Court and I agree.
 But having dispatched the question presented, the Court does not stop there. Instead, the Court proceeds to assert that the wire-fraud statute’s injury requirement is satisfied whenever a defendant “obtain[s] . . . property” that a victim “would not otherwise have parted with” by means of a material misrepresentation. Ante, at 11, n. 5. The Court’s commentary on this score might be easy to miss. It comes only in a brief footnote deep in the Court’s opinion. And on first glance, the Court’s remarks might seem innocuous enough. After all, one might wonder, if a fraud causes a victim to part with money or property, isn’t that necessarily an injury?
 I worry, though, that initial appearances may deceive and the Court’s stray footnote could portend trouble. Start with this difficulty: What the Court says in its footnote does not square with its reasoning above the line. Throughout the rest of its opinion, the Court recognizes that the wire-fraud statute’s references to a “scheme or artifice to defraud” and “false or fraudulent pretenses,” §1343 (emphasis added), bring with them the “old soil” of common-law fraud, ante, at 8. As a result, the common-law doctrines governing the crime of false pretenses, the tort of deceit, and the remedy of contractual rescission all inform, to one degree or another, the meaning of the wire-fraud statute. Ante, at 9–13. Yet, contrary to what the Court suggests in its footnote, at  common law “[t]he mere obtaining of money [or property] under false pretenses [did] not alone” satisfy fraud’s injury requirement. State v. Palmer, 50 Kan. 318, 324, 32 P. 29, 30 (1893); accord, State v. Casperson, 71 Utah 68, 75, 262 P. 294, 296 (1927). Instead, common-law courts usually demanded proof that a defendant deprived his victim of “what he bargained for.” State v. Asher, 50 Ark. 427, 430–431, 8 S. W. 177, 178 (1888). By the time Congress enacted the wire-fraud statute in 1952, it seems that “every American jurisdiction except Texas” had adopted a similar rule. Comment, Injury as an Element of Criminal Fraud, 23 U. Chi. L. Rev. 509, 511, and n. 7 (1956) (Injury as an Element).
 Nor is the difference between the Court’s formulation of fraud’s injury requirement and the common-law rule a negligible one. To be sure, obtaining money or property by means of a material misrepresentation will usually injure the victim. But not always. To appreciate why, some examples help. Start with some from the common law. In Rex v. Williams, 7 Car. & P. 354, 173 Eng. Rep. 158 (N. P. 1836) (Coleridge, J.), a creditor seeking to satisfy a debt ordered his servant to induce the debtor to hand over “two sacks of malt” by falsely representing that “his master had bought [them].” Ibid. Even though the servant “knowingly stated that which was false,” and his false statement was clearly material, his actions were not criminal because he merely intended to satisfy the debt, not to “defraud” the debtor. Id., at 355, 173 Eng. Rep., at 158. When facing similar facts, a New York court later remarked that “it is difficult to see” how a victim “would be injured” when he is merely “cheated” into paying what he owed. People v. Thomas, 3 Hill 169, 170 (N. Y. Sup. Ct. 1842); accord, People v. Baker, 96 N. Y. 340, 347–348 (1884); People v. Wakely, 62 Mich. 297, 300–303, 28 N. W. 871, 872–873 (1886).
 Contemporary examples under the federal wire-fraud statute illustrate the point, too. Imagine a bulk-mail com pany promises that it will use a “high-rate” service to deliver its customers’ products, but the company actually makes the deliveries “to the appropriate destination in a timely fashion” using a cheaper service. United States v. Starr, 816 F. 2d 94, 99–100 (CA2 1987). Doubtless, the company’s misrepresentations cause its customers to part with their money. Even so, as the Second Circuit has recognized, the company’s lies do not produce an injury because no “discrepancy [exists] between benefits ‘reasonably anticipated’ and actual benefits received.” Id., at 99; accord, United States v. Regent Office Supply Co., 421 F. 2d 1174, 1179–1180 (1970). Or suppose an applicant fibs on his resume about satisfying a condition of employment. He lands the job and he completes the work exactly as promised. The employee’s lie induces the company to part with money (his wages). But, as the D. C. Circuit has held, the employee’s lies do not injure the employer, because his “untruths do not deprive the employer of the benefit of its bargain.” United States v. Guertin, 67 F. 4th 445, 451 (2023); accord, United States v. Takhalov, 827 F. 3d 1307, 1313–1319 (CA11 2016); United States v. Shellef, 507 F. 3d 82, 108 (CA2 2007).2
  As all these examples highlight, the traditional benefit-of-the-bargain injury rule is not some vestigial limb. It plays an important role in separating mere lies from criminal frauds and, in that way, reducing the risk of frivolous prosecutions. Just ask yourself, if a “putative victim of wire fraud got exactly what he paid for, how exactly is he a victim at all?” United States v. Porat, 76 F. 4th 213, 227 (CA3 2023) (Krause, J., concurring). And what business is it of the government’s to punish victimless lies with prison time anyway?
 The Court’s footnote commentary thus is no small thing. By defying the traditional common-law rule, it risks turning prosecutors and courts into morality police with a commission to prosecute and punish harmless lies. Indeed, under the Court’s novel approach, it is hard to see what would save our babysitter from a federal wire-fraud conviction. Just consider: She intentionally lied. She did so using the wires. Her lie is material because it would matter to reasonable parents that someone working in their home with their children has a felony burglary conviction. The parents reasonably relied on the babysitter’s insistence that her record was clean. And they parted with money because of her lie. On the Court’s account, all the elements of the offense seem to be satisfied, and the babysitter’s fleeting misstatement may cost her up to 20 years in prison. The only way to ensure cases like our babysitter’s don’t become the domain of federal prosecutors and courts is to recognize what the common law has long recognized: Lies without injury are not criminal frauds.
II
 The Court’s footnote grapples with none of these difficulties. Instead, to support its suggestion that the loss of  money or property is always enough to establish an injury, the Court relies primarily on a decision from the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania. Ante, at 11–12, n. 5 (citing Williams v. Kerr, 152 Pa. 560, 565, 25 A. 618, 619 (1893)). But even that case does not stand for anything like the rule the Court imagines.
 In truth, Williams had no occasion to depart from the traditional injury rule. There, the defendant induced his victims to sell half their land by misrepresenting his plans to improve the lot—plans that (if true) would have “greatly enhance[d] the value” of the victims’ remaining share. Id., at 564, 25 A., at 619. Because the planned improvements turned out to be a fiction, the defendant failed to deliver what the sellers bargained for. Notably, too, Williams’s articulation of the injury rule is consistent with the traditional test. The court did not say that obtaining money or property by means of a material misrepresentation is always enough. Instead, the court suggested, it would be an injury to obtain money or property upon “terms” that the victim would not otherwise “accept.” Ibid. (emphasis added). And lying to get more favorable terms will often involve depriving a victim of “what was pretended and what he bargained for.” Casperson, 71 Utah, at 75, 262 P., at 296.
 The Court’s remaining common-law authorities are no more helpful to its cause. Neither MacLaren v. Cochran, 44 Minn. 255, 258, 46 N. W. 408, 409 (1890), nor Carlisle v. State, 76 Ala. 75, 77 (1884), mentions the money-or-property injury requirement the Court adopts. Meanwhile, the Court’s treatise supports a discussion of fraud’s injury element by citing a case endorsing the traditional rule that those who “obtai[n] all . . . they expected to obtain” are “not cheated or defrauded.” State v. Matthews, 44 Kan. 596, 606, 25 P. 36, 40 (1890) (cited in 1 E. McClain, Criminal Law  §680, p. 686 (1897)).3
 Not only do the Court’s common-law authorities fail to support its view about the nature of fraud’s injury requirement. Nothing in the text of the wire-fraud statute does either. That statute prohibits using the wires to carry out “any scheme or artifice to defraud . . . for obtaining money or property.” 18 U. S. C. §1343. As this Court has recognized, that language means a prosecutor must prove (1) the defendant “engage[d] in a ‘scheme or artifice to defraud,’ ” and (2) the “ ‘object of the fraud [was] “money or property” in the victim’s hands.’ ” Pasquantino v. United States, 544 U. S. 349, 355 (2005) (quoting Cleveland v. United States, 531 U. S. 12, 26 (2000) (alteration omitted)). So even when a prosecutor is able to show that the defendant sought to obtain money or property, he must still make the further showing that the defendant intended a “scheme or artifice to defraud”—a phrase that everyone agrees imports the traditional elements of common-law fraud. See ante, at 8, 11. And, as we have seen, those elements include an injury requirement that is not satisfied when a putative victim receives the benefit of his bargain.
 Left without common-law authority or statutory text to support its view, the Court seems to suggest that discarding the traditional injury rule at least might make for good policy. Though common-law courts have long asked whether  the defendant “ ‘delivered something different from what was promised,’ ” the argument appears to go, that test may be just too hard for today’s judges. Ante, at 14. Instead, we are told, fraud’s “materiality” element supplies a more “principled” and equally satisfactory way to distinguish mere lies from criminal fraud. Ante, at 15.
 But that is no answer at all. A judicial preference for “principled” rules cannot displace what is and has long been the law. When we look to the old soil of the common law for guidance, we have no license to plow over what we find there. Nor is the Court correct that fraud’s materiality element can shoulder all the work traditionally performed by its injury requirement. As this Court describes it, fraud’s materiality element usually asks “if a reasonable person would attach importance to [the defendant’s lie] in deciding how to proceed.” Ibid. (citing Universal Health Services, Inc. v. United States ex rel. Escobar, 579 U. S. 176, 193 (2016)). And, as the examples above illustrate, our fallen world is filled with lies, even material ones, that do not warrant the attention of criminal authorities: creditors who lie to recover their debts from evasive debtors, employees who fib about their credentials to get jobs, and even babysitters who misrepresent their pasts. In all of those cases, a reasonable person would attach significance to the defendant’s lie in deciding whether and how to proceed. In all of those cases, too, the lie is intentional, induces reasonable reliance, and causes someone to part with their money or property. Without the traditional injury requirement, every one of those cases gets swept into the prosecutor’s dragnet.
 Even taken on its own terms, the Court’s argument is misguided. The common-law materiality element is no more “principled” than the traditional injury rule. Ante, at 15. Yes, the traditional injury rule may require courts to assess whether the defendant delivered what he promised, and answering that question will not always be simple. See ibid. But the same holds true when it comes to the materiality element, where courts must decide whether a defendant misrepresented a “minor” (immaterial) term or an “essen[tial]” (material) one. Universal Health Services, Inc., 579 U. S., at 193–194, and n. 5.
 Take a prominent example in the Court’s opinion. Suppose a defendant promises to deliver a “ ‘horse called the Charley.’ ” Ante, at 15 (quoting State v. Mills, 17 Me. 211, 212 (1840)). That representation would be material if the parties’ dealings reveal that a reasonable person in the buyer’s shoes would care about the specific identity of the horse. But if those dealings indicate that, in the circumstances of a particular industry or transaction, a buyer would have been interested only in a horse of a particular kind and quality, the representation would not be material. When it comes to fraud’s materiality element, no less than when it comes to fraud’s injury element, details can matter, sometimes difficult lines must be drawn, and in drawing them courts may have to attend carefully to the circumstances surrounding the parties’ dealing.4
 If there is any good news when it comes to the Court’s footnote, it may be this: That digression is dicta addressing  a question well “beyond the case.” Cohens v. Virginia, 6 Wheat. 264, 399–400 (1821). Exactly nothing before us today turns on whether wire fraud’s injury requirement demands proof that the victim did not receive the benefit of his bargain or, instead, proof only that he parted with money or property. Nor is adopting one rule over another a necessary step toward the Court’s holding that “pecuniary loss” is not an “element of fraud.” Ante, at 12, n. 5.
 Just ask yourself: If the Court deleted its footnote, or reversed its position and endorsed the traditional injury rule, would its conclusion on economic loss be any different? Of course not. Under either view, Mr. Kousisis loses. He loses because his lies induced the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation to part with money when it paid him for the building projects in question. And he loses because the department did not receive what it bargained for in return: projects completed using “ ‘socially and economically disadvantaged’ ” firms. Ante, at 2; see also ante, at 4. Because Mr. Kousisis committed wire fraud under both the traditional injury rule and the Court’s novel one, the Court’s “throwaway footnot[e]” makes no difference. Royal Canin U. S. A., Inc. v. Wullschleger, 604 U. S. 22, 42–43 (2025).
 Try as it might, the Court cannot “transmute dictum into a decision by waving a wand and uttering the word ‘hold.’ ” United States v. Rubin, 609 F. 2d 51, 69, n. 2 (CA2 1979) (Friendly, J., concurring). And nothing in today’s decision can bind this Court in a future case where the difference between the two rules actually matters. See Seminole Tribe of Fla. v. Florida, 517 U. S. 44, 66 (1996); Loper Bright Enterprises v. Raimondo, 603 U. S. 369, 426 (2024) (GORSUCH, J., concurring).
*
 Over centuries of experience, common-law courts developed a variety of tools to sort venial lies from criminal frauds. In a brief and unfortunate diversion in an otherwise  sound opinion, the Court casts doubt on whether one of those tools still applies under the federal wire-fraud statute. In the process, the Court needlessly risks turning the federal wire-fraud statute into a weapon for punishing victimless crimes. I can only trust that future courts will recognize that aside for what it is—unsound dicta.

Notes
1  Countless cases and treatises support the Court’s conclusion that each of those common-law doctrines had an injury requirement. For the crime of false pretenses, see State v. Palmer, 50 Kan. 318, 323–324, 32 P. 29, 30 (1893); State v. Matthews, 44 Kan. 596, 602–603, 25 P. 36, 38 (1890); United States v. Rush, 196 F. 579 (ED Wash. 1912); 2 Bishop on Criminal Law §§415–417 (J. Zane & C. Zollman eds., 9th ed. 1923); 2 H. Brill, Cyclopedia of Criminal Law §1271 (1923). For the remedy of contractual rescission, see Williams v. Kerr, 152 Pa. 560, 565, 25 A. 618, 619 (1893); Spreckels v. Gorrill, 152 Cal. 383, 388, 92 P. 1011, 1015 (1907); 1 H. Black, Rescission of Contracts and Cancellation of Written Instruments §37, p. 90 (1916); 2 T. Parsons, Law of Contracts *268–*269 (4th ed. 1860). And for the tort of deceit, see Dura Pharmaceuticals, Inc. v. Broudo, 544 U. S. 336, 343–344 (2005).
2  Of course, the federal wire-fraud statute prohibits a “ ‘scheme to defraud,’ rather than [a] completed fraud,” so a defendant need not follow through on his plan to commit an offense. Neder v. United States, 527 U. S. 1, 25 (1999). But, as the cases above recognize, the injury element matters all the same. Modeled as it is after a common-law attempt offense, the wire-fraud statute requires proof of a “specific intent to commit the unlawful act.” Braxton v. United States, 500 U. S. 344, 351, n. (1991); see United States v. Coffman, 94 F. 3d 330, 333 (CA7 1996) (wire fraud “punishes . . . the attempt to defraud”). So the government must prove that a defendant’s intended scheme, if completed, would have left the victim without the benefit of the parties’ bargain, for “it is not a criminal attempt to try to do what the criminal law does not forbid you to do.” Id., at 333. The same goes for other elements of traditional fraud, like reasonable reliance and causation. Though the government need not prove actual reliance or causation to secure a wire-fraud conviction, Neder, 527 U. S., at 25, it must prove that the defendant intended those results, see ALI, Model Penal Code §5.01, Comment 2, p. 303 (1985) (attempt requires that a “defendant manifests a purpose . . . to cause the type of result that is forbidden by the criminal law”).
3  Without common-law authority to support its view, the Court resorts to disparaging contrary authority on the ground that some common-law cases discuss the benefit-of-the-bargain rule as a product of fraud’s intent or falsity elements, not its injury element. See ante, at 13, n. 6. But what does that prove? Only that common-law courts relied on various elements to enforce the benefit-of-the-bargain rule—not that courts rejected the requirement. It is unsurprising, too, that some courts considered injury in connection with the defendant’s “intent to defraud.” Ibid. After all, fraud can be prosecuted as an inchoate offense. So the government may secure a conviction by showing that a defendant intended all the elements of the completed crime, including injury and its benefit-of-the-bargain rule. Supra, at 5, n. 2; Injury as an Element 511, and n. 7.
4  Nor, contrary to the Court’s suggestion, is materiality a better option because it offers an “objective” standard. Ante, at 15, n. 7. The traditional test for injury, too, is an objective inquiry, asking whether “there exists a ‘discrepancy between benefits reasonably anticipated’ ” based on all the parties dealings and the “actual benefits which the defendant delivered, or intended to deliver.” United States v. Starr, 816 F. 2d 94, 98 (CA2 1987) (quoting United States v. Regent Office Supply Co., 421 F. 2d 1174, 1182 (CA2 1970); emphasis added). Interestingly, the Court’s proposal to cast aside fraud’s traditional injury rule and to rely instead on fraud’s materiality requirement is just the opposite of a proposal offered by the drafters of the Model Penal Code. They suggested abandoning the common-law materiality requirement altogether, even as they hewed to the traditional injury rule that it is not a criminal fraud to give a defendant “exactly what he bargained for.” ALI, Model Penal Code §223.3, Comment †, pp. 180–181, 194 (1980). The Court’s footnote does not pause to address why it would have us do exactly the reverse.

STAMATIOS KOUSISIS, ET AL., PETITIONERS v. UNITED STATES
on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the third circuit
________________________________________
[May 22, 2025]
________________________________________
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR, concurring in the judgment.
 The Court today rightly rejects petitioners’ request to graft an economic-loss requirement onto the federal wire fraud statute. When a defendant tricks a victim out of their money by promising one thing and delivering something materially different, it is no defense to say that the delivered items are of equal economic value. Statutory text, precedent, and history mandate that conclusion, as the majority explains. See ante, at 7–16. Common sense, unsurprisingly, points in the same direction. A Yankees fan deceived into buying Mets tickets is no less defrauded simply because the Mets tickets happen to be worth the same amount as the promised Yankees ones. That straightforward conclusion is all that is necessary to resolve this case, and I would go no further. To the extent the majority appears to speak more broadly, I part ways from its approach.
I
 As the majority explains, this case turns on the wire fraud statute’s property requirement, which limits the statute’s reach to schemes “to defraud, or for obtaining money or property.” 18 U. S. C. §1343. Although that phrase uses “disjunctive language,” the Court has construed it as a “unitary whole.” Kelly v. United States, 590 U. S. 391, 398  (2020) (citing §1343). That is because the “ ‘common understanding’ of the words ‘to defraud’ when the statute was enacted referred ‘to wronging one in his property rights.’ ” Ciminelli v. United States, 598 U. S. 306, 312 (2023) (quoting Cleveland v. United States, 531 U. S. 12, 19 (2000)). Accordingly, even before Congress amended the statute to add the phrase “or for obtaining money or property,” the statute criminalized “only schemes to deprive people of traditional property interests.” Ciminelli, 598 U. S., at 309; see also Cleveland, 531 U. S., at 18–19 (recounting §1343’s amendment history).
 Here, petitioners convinced the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation (PennDOT) to hand over tens of millions of dollars by lying about the nature of what they were selling. Petitioners promised to provide PennDOT with repair services that complied with the U. S. Department of Transportation’s Disadvantaged Business Enterprise (DBE) program. See 49 CFR §26.21 (2024). They represented to PennDOT that a qualified disadvantaged business would provide painting services for the restoration projects, as required by PennDOT’s federal grant, and they expressly memorialized that requirement as a “ ‘material’ ” term in their contracts. Ante, at 3 (majority opinion; quoting App. 114, 175). Yet petitioners planned all along to have nonqualified companies do the work, while the qualified disadvantaged business that they promised to work with served as a mere pass-through. Ante, at 3–4 (majority opinion). To put it simply, petitioners devised a scheme to trick PennDOT out of its money by promising one thing and delivering something materially different.
 Against that backdrop, petitioners’ only viable theory as to why PennDOT suffered no property loss hinges on their economic-loss theory. No property harm occurs for purposes of §1343, they argue, if the victim suffers no net pecuniary loss. See Reply Brief 2, 8. According to petitioners,  that makes all the difference here because the repair services petitioners provided to PennDOT were of equal monetary value. Id., at 8.
 Rejecting petitioners’ economic-loss theory therefore resolves this case, and I see no reason to go further. The Court, after all, granted certiorari to address circuit division on petitioners’ proposed economic-loss requirement, see ante, at 4–5 (majority opinion), and that is the question presented by the facts of this case.
 The Court therefore has no reason to opine on a class of fraudulent-inducement cases distinct from this one: those in which a defendant provides exactly the goods or services that they promised to deliver, but lies in other ways to induce the transaction. Cf. ante, at 2, 11 (GORSUCH, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment). A wide array of everyday transactional conduct might fall into that category. Consider, for instance, a babysitter who lands a job by fibbing about how she will use the money (for college savings, rather than a spring break trip), but otherwise fully and satisfactorily takes care of the child; a used car salesman who closes a deal by falsely claiming another buyer is coming to look at the car later that day, while truthfully disclosing all the pertinent details about the car; or a prospective housing developer who beats out competing bidders by lying about wanting to raise a family in the home, but pays the full amount of his bid. On the Government’s view, each of those cases may well give rise to federal fraud liability, punishable by up to 20 years in prison, so long as the jury deems the lie “material.” See Tr. of Oral Arg. 64–66; Brief for United States 44; 18 U. S. C. §1343.
 Future cases presenting such fact patterns will require the Court to confront the outer limits of the federal fraud statute’s reach and to decide what satisfies its materiality element. Resolving this case, however, requires no such undertaking. To the extent the majority discusses the viability of the Government’s fraudulent-inducement theory  more broadly, see, e.g., ante, at 6–8, 11–12, n. 5, I do not endorse its approach. That discussion is not essential to the Court’s resolution of the dispute before us, and I see no reason to proceed more broadly than necessary.
II
 This case presents only a narrow question in part because petitioners have not contested the materiality of their misrepresentations. See ante, at 16 (majority opinion). That concession makes good sense. There can be no real debate that petitioners’ misstatements were material. Contra, ante, at 4–11 (THOMAS, J., concurring).
A
 Recall that the parties presented two competing articulations of the materiality standard for the federal wire fraud statute. See ante, at 16 (majority opinion). Petitioners direct the Court to the “traditional” common-law test for materiality, Reply Brief 18, under which a representation is material if “ ‘a reasonable man would attach importance to its existence or nonexistence in determining his choice of action in the transaction in question,’ ” or “ ‘the maker of the representation knows or has reason to know that its recipient regards or is likely to regard the matter as important in determining his choice of action,’ ” Neder v. United States, 527 U. S. 1, 22, n. 5 (1999) (quoting Restatement (Second) of Torts §538 (1977)). Petitioners assert that, under their formulation, representations need “ ‘not go to [the] essence’ ” of the transaction to qualify as material. Reply Brief 18 (quoting Restatement (Second) of Torts §551(2)(e), Comment j). Counterintuitively, it is the Government that proposes a more demanding standard. It asserts that misstatements are material only if they go to the very “ ‘essence of the bargain’ ” at issue. Brief for United States 44. That standard stems from Universal Health Services, Inc. v. United States ex rel. Escobar, 579 U. S. 176 (2016), which  discussed materiality under the False Claims Act. See id., at 193, n. 5.
 The Court need not resolve this dispute to know that petitioners correctly conceded materiality: Even under the more demanding “essence of the bargain” test, petitioners’ misstatements qualify. Starting with the contract itself, PennDOT expressly made compliance with federal DBE regulations a “material” term. See App. 114, 175. That was no boilerplate designation. Out of the 17 warranties set forth in the signed documents, only the DBE requirement expressly provided that “[f]ailure by the Contractor to carry out these requirements is a material breach of this contract, which may result in the termination of this contract.” Ibid. PennDOT, moreover, dedicated an entire phase of the contract bidding process to confirming that its prospective contractor had identified a qualified DBE partner who would provide painting services. See 3 App. in No. 19–3679 etc. (CA3), pp. 763–765; 82 F. 4th 230, 234 (CA3 2023). Petitioners also had to submit documentation throughout the projects’ duration to demonstrate continued compliance with the DBE requirement. See id., at 234.
 What is more, PennDOT could not have proceeded with the projects as funded if it had not mandated contractor compliance with the DBE requirement. Federal grants accounted for a significant portion of PennDOT’s funding for each project, and those grants were conditioned on DBE compliance. The contracts’ DBE requirement thus went directly to the viability of the projects themselves, and by extension, to the “ ‘very essence of the bargain.’ ” Universal Health Services, 579 U. S., at 193–194, n. 5 (quoting Junius Constr. Corp. v. Cohen, 257 N. Y. 393, 400, 178 N. E. 672, 674 (1931)); cf. 579 U. S., at 194 (recognizing materiality where “ ‘[t]he government’s money would never have been placed in the joint fund for payment to respondents had its agents known the bids were collusive’ ” (quoting United States ex rel. Marcus v. Hess, 317 U. S. 537, 543 (1943)).
  If that were not already enough, PennDOT risked legal sanction if it failed to administer the DBE program in good faith. See 49 CFR §§26.101, 26.107; 2 App. in No. 19–3679 etc., at 305 (“If [a grant recipient] fail[s] to comply with any requirement mentioned in this rule,” including the DBE requirement, “they could be subject to formal enforcement action or program sanctions such as suspension or termination of federal funds or refusal to approve projects, grants, or contracts until those deficiencies are remedied”); id., at 290 (“[I]f you fail to operate your program in good faith, . . . [ y]ou will be subject to possible withholding of funds, revoking of funds, or other sanctions available by the Department”). It is implausible that compliance with the DBE requirement was immaterial to PennDOT when knowledge of petitioners’ scheme to flout those requirements would have exposed PennDOT to risk of serious legal consequences. See Universal Health Services, 579 U. S., at 194 (“[A]n undisclosed fact [is] material” where “ ‘[n]o one can say with reason that the plaintiff would have signed this contract if informed of the likelihood’ of the undisclosed fact” (quoting Junius Constr. Corp., 257 N. Y., at 400, 178 N. E., at 674)).
 In short, DBE compliance was no “minor or insubstantial” provision tucked away in a laundry list of other requirements for payment. Universal Health Services, 579 U. S., at 194. It played a critical role in PennDOT’s ability to achieve the essential goal of the contracts: completing the restoration projects. It featured prominently in the contracts and in the bidding process itself. And petitioners were well aware of its importance to PennDOT. After all, they orchestrated an entire scheme to hide their noncompliance. The materiality of petitioners’ misstatements is thus hard to dispute, even under the Government’s more demanding standard.
B
 It is no answer to suggest that DBE fraud is “rampant.” Ante, at 9 (THOMAS, J., concurring). “Lots of people do it” has never been, nor should be, a defense to criminal liability without more. No cited portion of the record, moreover, supports the view that PennDOT “regularly pa[id contracts] in full despite actual knowledge that [the relevant] requirements were violated,” Universal Health Services, 579 U. S., at 195, or that PennDOT “assume[d] a significant number of its contractors violate contract provisions requiring DBE compliance,” ante, at 8 (THOMAS, J., concurring). If that were true, petitioners would have had no reason to develop an elaborate scheme to conceal their noncompliance in the first place.
 Generic reports from decades prior of “ ‘serious enforcement and compliance problems’ ” with a federal program do not negate the materiality of explicit contractual terms requiring compliance either. Ante, at 9 (THOMAS, J., concurring) (quoting Oversight Hearing on the Elimination of Waste, Fraud, and Abuse in Mandatory Transportation Programs before the House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, 108th Cong., 1st Sess., 109 (2003)).1 We have never suggested, let alone held, that such reports give defendants a get-out-of-jail-free card. With good reason: That view relies on the premise that, whenever fraud is prevalent, no reasonable contractor can expect compliance, even where the contract expressly deems compliance material. To accept that premise is to turn contract law upside  down. Parties explicitly designate contractual terms as material in order to ensure compliance, particularly where the other party might not otherwise comply.
 Petitioners would have had similar trouble contesting materiality on the ground that, at some point in the future, the DBE statutory scheme might be deemed unconstitutional. Indeed, petitioners at no pertinent time raised a challenge to the DBE program’s constitutionality, and the DBE statutory scheme remains good law (as it was at the time of petitioners’ conviction).2 It should go without saying that the law should not provide a shield from criminal liability based upon personal and unspoken predictions of a law’s constitutionality.
*  *  *
 At bottom, this case presents a classic scheme to defraud: Petitioners tricked PennDOT into paying for one thing, and then delivered something materially different. The Court today rightly holds that a defendant in that position may not escape federal fraud liability by asserting the victim nevertheless suffered no net economic loss. On that basis, I agree with the majority’s bottom-line decision to affirm the Third Circuit’s judgment.
________________________________________
Notes
1 JUSTICE THOMAS appears to agree. See ante, at 9–10, n. 2. Although his concurring opinion sets forth “reasons to think that the DBE provisions did not go ‘to the very essence of the bargain’ ” to explain his “skeptic[ism] that petitioners’ misrepresentations were material,” ante, at 1, 6, JUSTICE THOMAS later acknowledges that his discussion of these reports is intended only to suggest his “materiality analysis might apply in different DBE-compliance prosecutions where ‘materiality is contested’ ” and a different record is developed, ante, at 9–10, n. 2. I do not share his view of the proper materiality analysis, but at least all agree such reports are irrelevant in this case.
2 See ante, at 11, n. 3 (THOMAS, J., concurring) (indicating agreement that, as a result, petitioners could not have raised a materiality argument on this ground).


گواهی به دادگاه تجدیدنظر ایالات متحده برای حوزه سوم
_________________________________________
شماره ۲۳–۹۰۹. مطرح شده در ۹ دسامبر ۲۰۲۴ - رأی داده شده در ۲۲ مه ۲۰۲۵
___________________________________________________
وزارت حمل و نقل پنسیلوانیا (PennDOT) دو قرارداد برای پروژه‌های نقاشی در فیلادلفیا به شاکیان Stamatios Kousisis و Alpha Painting and Construction Co. اعطا کرد. مقررات فدرال، اعطاکنندگان قرارداد را ملزم می‌کرد که بخشی از هر قرارداد را به یک شرکت تجاری محروم واگذار کنند. بنابراین، به عنوان بخشی از فرآیند مناقصه، Kousisis به دروغ ادعا کرد که Alpha لوازم رنگ خود را از Markias, Inc.، یک شرکت تجاری محروم که از قبل صلاحیت آن تأیید شده بود، تهیه می‌کند. این یک دروغ بود. بدون اطلاع PennDOT، Kousisis ترتیب داد که Markias صرفاً به عنوان یک نهاد "عبور از مرز" عمل کند. Markias به عنوان یک نهاد عبور از مرز، هیچ لوازم رنگی ارائه نداد. برعکس، تنها نقش آن، انتقال چک‌ها و فاکتورها به و از تأمین‌کنندگان واقعی آلفا بود. این ترتیب نه تنها با اظهارات قبلی کوسیس مغایرت داشت، بلکه الزام انجام یک «عملکرد مفید تجاری» توسط مشاغل محروم را نیز نقض می‌کرد. 49 CFR §26.55(c). با این حال، در نهایت، آلفا پروژه‌های نقاشی را مطابق با رضایت PennDOT انجام داد و بیش از 20 میلیون دلار سود ناخالص به جیب زد.

دولت، آلفا و کوسیس را به کلاهبرداری بانکی و توطئه برای ارتکاب همین کار متهم کرد. 18 U. S. C. §§1343, 1349. این اتهامات بر اساس نظریه تحریک متقلبانه مطرح شده بود - به عبارت دیگر، شاکیان PennDOT را وادار کرده بودند که قراردادهای نقاشی را با ادعاهای اساساً نادرست به آنها اعطا کند. پس از اینکه هیئت منصفه، آلفا و کوسیس را به کلاهبرداری بانکی محکوم کرد، آنها درخواست تبرئه کردند. از نظر آنها، علیرغم عدم مشارکت کسب و کارهای محروم، PennDOT از معامله خود به طور کامل سود اقتصادی برده بود. بنابراین، شاکیان ادعا کردند که دولت نمی‌تواند ثابت کند که آنها طبق ماده ۱۳۴۳، برای کلاهبرداری از PennDOT در مورد «پول یا اموال» برنامه‌ریزی کرده بودند. حوزه قضایی سوم این استدلال را رد کرد و اختلاف نظر در مورد اعتبار محکومیت کلاهبرداری فدرال را زمانی که متهم به دنبال وارد کردن ضرر مالی خالص به قربانی نبوده است، عمیق‌تر کرد.

رأی صادر شده: متهمی که قربانی را به انجام معامله‌ای تحت ادعاهای اساساً نادرست ترغیب می‌کند، ممکن است به کلاهبرداری فدرال محکوم شود، حتی اگر متهم به دنبال وارد کردن ضرر اقتصادی به قربانی نبوده باشد. صفحات ۵-۲۰.

(الف) برای محکوم کردن آلفا و کوسیس، دولت باید ثابت می‌کرد که آنها از این تراکنش‌ها برای اجرای «طرح یا حیله‌ای برای کلاهبرداری یا به دست آوردن پول یا اموال از طریق ادعاهای نادرست یا متقلبانه، اظهارات یا وعده‌ها» استفاده کرده‌اند. ماده ۱۳۴۳. طبق رویه قضایی این دادگاه، متهم تنها در صورتی مرتکب کلاهبرداری الکترونیکی می‌شود که هم در فریبکاری دست داشته باشد و هم پول یا اموال به عنوان موضوع کلاهبرداری او باشد. به Ciminelli v. United States, 598 U. S. 306, 312 مراجعه کنید. آلفا و کوسیس می‌گویند از این قاعده نتیجه می‌شود که محکومیت کلاهبرداری فدرال نمی‌تواند پابرجا بماند مگر اینکه متهم به دنبال وارد کردن ضرر مالی خالص به قربانی بوده باشد. چنین نیست. نظریه تحریک متقلبانه هم با متن ماده 1343 و هم با رویه قضایی این دادگاه سازگار است. صفحات 5-20. 
(1) متن ماده 1343 به ضرر اقتصادی اشاره نمی‌کند، چه برسد به اینکه آن را الزامی کند. در واقع، رفتار آلفا و کوسیس هر عنصر ماده 1343 را برآورده می‌کرد: آنها طرحی را برای "دریافت پول" (ده‌ها میلیون) از PennDOT از طریق اظهارات دروغین در مورد رعایت الزام کسب و کار محروم، طراحی کردند. و در حالی که شاکیان خلاف این را استدلال می‌کنند، یک طرح ممکن است حتی اگر خوانده چیزی ارزشمند در ازای آن ارائه دهد، همچنان کلاهبرداری الکترونیکی محسوب شود. «به دست آوردن» به معنای «به دست آوردن یا تصاحب کردن» است، فرهنگ لغت بین‌المللی سوم وبستر ۱۵۵۹، و پول یا دارایی صرفاً به این دلیل که چیز دیگری در ازای آن داده می‌شود، «به دست آمده» است. صفحات ۷-۸. 
(2) شاکیان استدلال می‌کنند که ضرر اقتصادی در ذات درک عرفی از کلاهبرداری است، اصطلاحی که دو بار در قانون کلاهبرداری الکترونیکی آمده است. اما وقتی کنگره از یک اصطلاح عرفی استفاده می‌کند، این فرض که اصطلاح «خاک قدیمی خود را با خود می‌آورد» فقط تا حدی اعمال می‌شود که این اصطلاح معنای ثابتی داشته باشد. Sekhar v. United States, 570 U. S. 729, 733. در عرفی، اصطلاح «کلاهبرداری» دامنه گسترده‌ای داشت؛ عناصر و راه‌حل‌های آن به آسیب ادعایی شاکی بستگی داشت. برای مثال، در دعاوی فسخ قرارداد یا پیگرد قانونی به دلیل ادعاهای دروغین، اکثر دادگاه‌ها از قربانی نخواستند که ضرر اقتصادی را اثبات کند. در عوض، کافی بود که قربانی «مالی با ماهیت یا شرایط متفاوت از آنچه وعده داده شده بود دریافت کرده باشد»، حتی اگر ارزش آن برابر باشد. W. Keeton, D. Dobbs, R. Keeton, & D. Owen, Prosser and Keeton on Law of Torts §110, p. 766 (Prosser & Keeton). به عبارت دیگر، دادگاه‌های کامن لا عموماً محرومیت از اموال ناشی از فریب - نه ضرر اقتصادی - را مضر می‌دانستند. به Stillwell v. Rankin, 55 Mont. 130, 135, 174 P. 186, 187 مراجعه کنید. در مقابل، ضرر ناشی از فریب: برای داشتن یک دلیل کامل برای طرح دعوی، شاکی باید متحمل ... شده باشد.ضرر اقتصادی. به Prosser & Keeton §110، در صفحه 765 مراجعه کنید. در مجموع، بنابراین، قانون عرفی یک قاعده کلی که مستلزم ضرر اقتصادی در همه موارد کلاهبرداری باشد، وضع نکرده است، بنابراین دادگاه چنین الزامی را در قانون عرفی §1343 نخواهد خواند. صفحات 8-13. 
(3) شاکیان اذعان می‌کنند که قانون عرفی در هر موردی مستلزم ضرر اقتصادی نبوده است. اما استثنای ادعایی آنها - مواردی که در آن یا شاکی "چیزی متفاوت از آنچه وعده داده شده بود" دریافت کرده است یا معامله "شامل کالایی با ویژگی‌های منحصر به فرد بوده است"، پاسخ مختصر 15 - فاقد یک اصل محرک است. در سطح مناسب از ویژگی، هر چیزی را می‌توان "منحصر به فرد" یا "متفاوت از" چیز دیگری توصیف کرد. در واقع، قانون عرفی مدت‌هاست که استاندارد متفاوتی - یعنی اهمیت - را به عنوان مبنای اصولی برای تمایز تحریف‌های روزمره از کلاهبرداری قابل پیگیری پذیرفته است. امروز، دیوان مجدداً تأکید می‌کند که «اهمیت دروغ، عنصری از» و بنابراین محدودیتی بر قوانین فدرال مربوط به کلاهبرداری است. ندر علیه ایالات متحده، 527 U. S. 1, 25. اما از آنجا که آلفا و کوسیس به اهمیت اظهارات خود اعتراض نکرده‌اند، دیوان به بحث طرفین در مورد معیار مناسب برای اهمیت طبق ماده 1343 رسیدگی نمی‌کند. صفحات 14-16. 
(ب) نظریه تحریک متقلبانه نه توسط رویه دیوان رد می‌شود و نه با آن مغایرت دارد. دادگاه دو بار این استدلال را که محکومیت کلاهبرداری به ضرر اقتصادی بستگی دارد، رد کرده است، ابتدا در پرونده کارپنتر علیه ایالات متحده، بند 484 قانون ایالات متحده 19، و سپس در پرونده شاو علیه ایالات متحده، بند 580 قانون ایالات متحده 63. و علیرغم استدلال‌های مخالف آلفا و کوسیس، نظریه تحریک متقلبانه، محکومیت کلاهبرداری را که صرفاً بر اساس دخالت در قدرت تنظیم مقررات ایالت باشد، مجاز نمی‌داند. صرف نظر از نظریه زیربنایی کلاهبرداری، ماده 1343 مقرر می‌دارد که «پول یا مال» موضوع طرح کلاهبرداری بوده است. الزام پول یا مال همچنین توضیح می‌دهد که چرا نظریه تحریک متقلبانه، همانطور که شاکیان معتقدند، تمایز بین قانون کلاهبرداری الکترونیکی و قوانینی که توطئه برای کلاهبرداری از ایالات متحده را ممنوع می‌کنند، رجوع کنید به 18 قانون ایالات متحده §371، و اظهارات نادرست یا متقلبانه در امور فدرال، رجوع کنید به §1001 را از بین نمی‌برد. همچنین این نظریه، رویه قضایی این دادگاه را که معتقد است، گذشته از استثنای خدمات صادقانه، ماده ۱۳۴۳ «از منافع ناملموس غیرمرتبط با حقوق مالکیت سنتی محافظت نمی‌کند» تضعیف نمی‌کند. Ciminelli، ۵۹۸ U. S.، صفحه ۳۱۲. اگر طرحی به جای آن، نوعی از منافع ناملموس - مثلاً منافع یک شهروند در «دولت بی‌طرف» - را هدف قرار دهد، نظریه ترغیب متقلبانه قابل اجرا نیست. McNally v. United States، ۴۸۳ U. S. ۳۵۰، ۳۵۵. در نهایت، نظریه ترغیب متقلبانه، نظریه حق کنترل رد شده در Ciminelli را «بازسازی» نمی‌کند. برخلاف نظریه حق کنترل، ترغیب متقلبانه «صرف اطلاعات را به عنوان منافع محافظت‌شده» در نظر نمی‌گیرد. ۵۹۸ U. S.، صفحه ۳۱۵. در عوض، از پول و اموال محافظت می‌کند. صفحات ۱۶-۱۹. (ج) نظریه‌ی ترغیب متقلبانه، خطر تبدیل هر گونه ارائه‌ی نادرست اطلاعات که برای ایجاد یک معامله طراحی شده است را به کلاهبرداری در اموال، به جان نمی‌خرد. در عوض، این نظریه نوع خاصی از کلاهبرداری را جرم‌انگاری می‌کند و الزام «مادی بودن» آن، به طور قابل توجهی دامنه‌ی ارائه‌ی نادرست اطلاعات قابل پیگرد قانونی را محدود می‌کند. Universal Health Services, Inc. v. United States ex rel. Escobar, 579 U. S. 176, 194. و در حالی که قانون کلاهبرداری الکترونیکی گسترده است، تغییر آن به عهده‌ی کنگره است، در صورت تمایل، تغییر آن. P. 19.

[22 مه 2025]
________________________________________
قاضی بارت نظر دادگاه را اعلام کرد. 
Stamatios Kousisis و شرکت نقاشی صنعتی که او به مدیریت آن کمک می‌کرد، شرکت نقاشی و ساخت و ساز آلفا، دو قرارداد دولتی برای پروژه‌های نقاشی در فیلادلفیا را به دست آوردند. هر دو قرارداد مستلزم مشارکت یک کسب و کار محروم بود - و آلفا در پیشنهادات خود برای این پروژه‌ها به وزارت حمل و نقل پنسیلوانیا (PennDOT) اعلام کرد که مواد خود را از یک تأمین‌کننده واجد شرایط تهیه خواهد کرد. به 49 CFR §§26.21(a), 26.5 (2024) مراجعه کنید. این وعده پوچ از آب درآمد: علاوه بر استفاده از تأمین‌کنندهآلفا و کوسیس صرفاً به عنوان یک نهاد واسطه، چندین گواهی جعلی برای لاپوشانی طرح خود ارائه کردند. بنابراین، اگرچه کار رنگ‌آمیزی آلفا انتظارات را برآورده کرد، اما پایبندی آن به الزام کسب و کار محروم، انتظارات را برآورده نکرد.

دولت، آلفا و کوسیس را به کلاهبرداری بانکی متهم کرد و ادعا کرد که آنها با فریب، PennDOT را وادار به اعطای قراردادهای نقاشی به آنها کرده‌اند. به ماده 18 قانون ایالات متحده، بخش 1343 مراجعه کنید. طبق نظریه ترغیب متقلبانه، متهم هر زمان که از یک اظهارنامه نادرست مادی برای فریب قربانی به قراردادی که مستلزم تحویل پول یا اموال اوست استفاده کند، مرتکب کلاهبرداری فدرال می‌شود - صرف نظر از اینکه آیا کلاهبردار، که اغلب چیزی در عوض ارائه می‌دهد، به دنبال وارد کردن ضرر مالی خالص به قربانی است یا خیر. ما باید تصمیم بگیریم که آیا این نظریه با ماده 1343 سازگار است، که فقط به طرح‌هایی می‌پردازد که منافع سنتی پول یا اموال را هدف قرار می‌دهند. به Ciminelli v. United States, 598 U. S. 306, 316 (2023) مراجعه کنید. بنابراین، ما تأیید می‌کنیم که همینطور است.

وقتی دو بنای تاریخی فیلادلفیا، پل گیرارد پوینت و ایستگاه خیابان سی‌ام، رو به ویرانی رفتند، اداره حمل و نقل پن شروع به جمع‌آوری پیشنهاد برای بازسازی آنها کرد. کوسیس، مدیر پروژه آلفا، برای هر پروژه پیشنهادی ارائه داد. پیشنهاد او موفقیت‌آمیز بود: در مورد پروژه گیرارد پوینت، اداره حمل و نقل پن قراردادی ۷۰.۳ میلیون دلاری را به یک سرمایه‌گذاری مشترک متشکل از آلفا و دو شرکت دیگر واگذار کرد. و در مورد پروژه خیابان سی‌ام، آلفا و یک شرکت دیگر (که دوباره به عنوان یک سرمایه‌گذاری مشترک فعالیت می‌کرد) قراردادی فرعی ۱۵ میلیون دلاری را تضمین کردند که تقریباً یک سوم از کل پیشنهاد برنده ۵۰.۸ میلیون دلاری را تشکیل می‌داد. 
کمک‌های مالی فدرال از وزارت حمل و نقل ایالات متحده (DOT) بخش بزرگی از بودجه هر پروژه را تشکیل می‌داد. در نتیجه، هم دولت ایالتی و هم دولت فدرال در مورد نحوه تکمیل پروژه‌ها نظر داشتند. در اینجا، وزارت حمل و نقل (DOT) از دریافت‌کنندگان کمک‌های مالی مانند PennDOT می‌خواهد که یک برنامه کسب و کار محروم را ایجاد و «به طور فعال اجرا» کنند. 49 CFR §§26.21, 26.39(c)؛ همچنین به 112 Stat. 113–115 مراجعه کنید. طبق گفته وزارت حمل و نقل، «یک شرکت تجاری [مستضعف]»، «یک کسب و کار کوچک انتفاعی» است که اکثریت مالکیت و کنترل آن «توسط یک یا چند نفر که از نظر اجتماعی و اقتصادی محروم هستند» انجام می‌شود. §26.5 (ایتالیک حذف شده است). از آنجا که وزارت حمل و نقل آرزو دارد حداقل 10 درصد از بودجه کمک‌های مالی فدرال را به چنین کسب و کارهایی اختصاص دهد، دریافت‌کنندگان کمک‌های مالی باید «هدف[های] کلی» را برای مشارکت کسب و کارهای محروم در «قراردادهای تحت حمایت DOT» خود تعیین کنند. §§26.41, 26.45(a)(1).
مطابق با این قانون، PennDOT از پیشنهاددهندگان پروژه‌های Girard Point و 30th Street خواست که درصدی از کل مبلغ قرارداد - به ترتیب شش و هفت درصد - را به یک کسب‌وکار محروم واگذار کنند. عدم رعایت این الزام، "نقض اساسی" محسوب می‌شد و می‌توانست "منجر به فسخ [قرارداد] شود." App. 114, 175. بر این اساس، به عنوان بخشی از فرآیند مناقصه، کوسیس اظهار داشت که آلفا تقریباً 6.4 میلیون دلار لوازم نقاشی از Markias, Inc.، یک کسب‌وکار محروم پیش‌صلاحیت‌شده، خریداری خواهد کرد.

این یک دروغ بود. همانطور که بعداً در یک تعهدنامه ذکر شد، آلفا و کوسیس طرحی را طراحی کردند که در آن مارکیاس صرفاً به عنوان یک نهاد "انتقالی" عمل می‌کرد. این طرح به شرح زیر عمل می‌کرد: کوسیس ترتیب داد تا تأمین‌کنندگان رنگ واقعی آلفا، که مستقیماً با آنها مذاکره می‌کرد، "سفارش‌های خرید ... را به نام مارکیاس صادر کنند." همان، صفحه ۱۹۳. وقتی مارکیاس فاکتوری دریافت می‌کرد، چند درصد کارمزد به آن اضافه می‌کرد و سپس فاکتور اغراق‌آمیز را برای کوسیسیس ارسال می‌کرد. او نیز به نوبه خود، دو چک صادر می‌کرد: یکی برای افزایش قیمت مارکیاس و دیگری برای پوشش هزینه واقعی لوازم. به طور خلاصه، مارکیاس چیزی بیش از یک دلال کاغذ نبود که چک‌ها و فاکتورها را به تأمین‌کنندگان واقعی آلفا و از آنها ارسال می‌کرد. این ترتیب نه تنها با اظهارات قبلی کوسیسیس مغایرت داشت، بلکه با قانون وزارت حمل و نقل مبنی بر اینکه یک کسب و کار محروم مشارکت‌کننده باید "یک عملکرد مفید تجاری انجام دهد" نیز مغایرت داشت. §26.55(c).1
طرح کوسیسیس در ابتدا کشف نشد. با پیشرفت پروژه‌ها، او به دروغ پرداخت‌های واجد شرایط را به مارکیاس گزارش داد. PennDOT که از کار رنگ‌آمیزی و تعمیر آلفا راضی بود، آن را بر اساس آن پرداخت کرد. تا زمانی که آخرین لایه رنگ خشک شد، آلفا سود ناخالصی بالغ بر ۲۰ میلیون دلار کسب کرده بود. و مارکیاس، به دلیل خدمات «انتقال وجه» خود، در مجموع حدود ۱۷۰،۰۰۰ دلار به جیب زده بود.


به محض آشکار شدن این فریب، هیئت منصفه عالی، آلفا و کوسیس را به جرم کلاهبرداری و توطئه برای ارتکاب همان جرم، متهم کرد. به ۱۸ قانون ایالات متحده، بخش ۱۳۴۳، ۱۳۴۹ مراجعه کنید. پس از محاکمه، هیئت منصفه آنها را به سه فقره کلاهبرداری و یک فقره توطئه مجرم شناخت. آلفا و کوسیس برای صدور حکم تبرئه اقدام کردند و استدلال کردند که چون رنگ‌آمیزی آنها انتظارات PennDOT را برآورده کرده است، PennDOT از سود اقتصادی کامل معامله خود بهره‌مند شده است. بنابراین، علیرغم عدم مشارکت مشاغل محروم، دولت نتوانست ثابت کند که آنها برای کلاهبرداری از PennDOT در مورد «پول یا اموال» توطئه کرده‌اند، همانطور که قانون کلاهبرداری فدرال در مورد کلاهبرداری در نقل و انتقال وجه بیان می‌کند.quires. §1343. 
دادگاه ناحیه این استدلال را رد کرد و دادگاه حوزه سوم محکومیت‌ها را تأیید کرد. همانطور که هر دو دادگاه توضیح دادند، «به دست آوردن پول یا اموال [دولت] دقیقاً هدف» «طرح کلاهبرداری آلفا و کوسیس بود.» 82 F. 4th 230, 240 (2023)؛ همچنین به 2019 WL 4126484, *13 (ED Pa., June 17, 2019) مراجعه کنید («[این] طرح پول PennDOT را هدف قرار داد، زیرا این آژانس برای خدمات - ساخت و ساز انجام شده با مصالحی که توسط یک [کسب و کار محروم] تهیه شده بود - که آن را دریافت نکرده بود - هزینه پرداخت کرد»). «به عبارت ساده،» آلفا و کوسیس «برای به دست آوردن میلیون‌ها دلار که اگر به خاطر ارائه اطلاعات نادرست و متقلبانه‌شان نبود، دریافت نمی‌کردند، اقدام کردند.» 82 F. 4th، صفحه 240.


دادگاه‌های قضایی در مورد اعتبار محکومیت کلاهبرداری فدرال در صورتی که متهم به دنبال وارد کردن ضرر مالی خالص به قربانی نبوده باشد، اختلاف نظر دارند. چندین حوزه قضایی، از جمله حوزه قضایی سوم، معتقدند که چنین محکومیت‌هایی ممکن است پابرجا باشند. به عنوان مثال، رجوع کنید به همان، صفحه 240-244؛ ایالات متحده علیه لیهی، 464 F. 3d 773، 787-789 (CA7 2006)؛ ایالات متحده علیه گرنبری، 908 F. 2d 278، 280 (CA8 1990)؛ ایالات متحده علیه ریشتر، 796 F. 3d 1173، 1192 (CA10 2015). برخی دیگر مخالفند. به عنوان مثال، رجوع کنید به ایالات متحده علیه شلف، 507 F. 3d 82، 108-109 (CA2 2007)؛ ایالات متحده علیه Sadlar، 750 F. 3d 585, 590–592 (CA6 2014)؛ ایالات متحده علیه Bruchhausen، 977 F. 2d 464, 467–468 (CA9 1992)؛ ایالات متحده علیه Takhalov، 827 F. 3d 1307, 1312–1314 (CA11 2016)؛ ایالات متحده علیه Guertin، 67 F. 4th 445, 450–452 (CADC 2023). ما برای حل اختلاف، certiorari اعطا کردیم. 602 U. S. ___ (2024). II
برای محکوم کردن آلفا و کوسیس، دولت باید ثابت می‌کرد که آنها از حواله‌های بانکی برای اجرای «طرح یا حیله‌ای برای کلاهبرداری، یا برای به دست آوردن پول یا اموال از طریق تظاهر، نمایش یا وعده‌های دروغین یا متقلبانه» استفاده کرده‌اند. 18 U. S. C. §1343. علیرغم استفاده از حرف ربط «یا»، ما از تفسیر §1343 به عنوان ایجاد مسیرهای جایگزین برای محکومیت خودداری کرده‌ایم. در عوض، با خواندن دو بند با هم، ما معتقدیم که «الزام پول یا اموال عبارت اخیر» به عنوان محدودیتی برای مورد اول عمل می‌کند. McNally v. United States, 483 U. S. 350, 358–360 (1987).2 به عبارت دیگر، یک متهم تنها در صورتی مرتکب کلاهبرداری بانکی فدرال می‌شود که هم «در فریبکاری» مشارکت داشته باشد و هم «پول یا اموال» را به عنوان «موضوع» کلاهبرداری خود داشته باشد. Ciminelli، 598 U. S.، در صفحه 312 (به نقل از Kelly v. United States، 590 U. S. 391, 398 (2020)).

الزام پول یا دارایی در قلب این اختلاف قرار دارد. اگرچه دادگاه‌های پایین‌تر زمانی عبارت "پول یا دارایی" را به عنوان یک مفهوم کلی تفسیر می‌کردند، اما ما اخیراً مجدداً تأکید کردیم که قوانین کلاهبرداری فدرال فقط به "منافع مالکیت سنتی" مربوط می‌شود. Ciminelli، 598 U. S.، در صفحه 316. به عنوان مثال، طرح‌هایی که اعمال قدرت نظارتی دولت را هدف قرار می‌دهند، به حساب نمی‌آیند. به Kelly، 590 U. S.، در صفحه 400 مراجعه کنید؛ همچنین به Cleveland v. United States، 531 U. S. 12, 23–24 (2000) مراجعه کنید. همچنین طرح‌هایی که به دنبال محروم کردن دیگری از "منافع ناملموس غیرمرتبط با دارایی" هستند، به حساب نمی‌آیند. Ciminelli، 598 U. S.، صفحه 315؛ همچنین رجوع کنید به McNally، 483 U. S.، صفحه 356.3 و در همه موارد، از آنجا که پول یا اموال باید موضوع کلاهبرداری متهم باشد، منافع سنتی اموال مورد بحث «باید نقشی بیش از یک نقش جزئی در یک طرح داشته باشد». Kelly، 590 U. S.، صفحه 402. به دست آوردن پول یا اموال قربانی باید «هدف» کلاهبرداری متهم بوده باشد، نه یک «محصول جانبی تصادفی» آن. همان، صفحه 402، 404.
از این قوانین، آلفا و کوسیس تلاش می‌کنند تا نکته دیگری را استخراج کنند: آنها استدلال می‌کنند که محکومیت کلاهبرداری فدرال نمی‌تواند پابرجا باشد، مگر اینکه متهم به دنبال آسیب رساندن به منافع قربانی بوده باشد. خلاصه برای شاکیان 2؛ خلاصه پاسخ 8. با این حال، نظریه‌ای که شاکیان بر اساس آن تحت پیگرد قانونی قرار گرفتند - آنچه آنها نظریه تحریک متقلبانه می‌نامند - فاقد الزام ضرر اقتصادی است. همانطور که هر دو طرف توصیف می‌کنند، این نظریه از مسئولیت کلاهبرداری فدرال در هر زمانی که خوانده «از دروغ برای وادار کردن قربانی به انجام معامله استفاده می‌کند» حمایت می‌کند. خلاصه برای دادخواهان ۲۹ (به نقل از خلاصه در مخالفت ۹). در این شرایط، خوانده نیازی ندارد - و با توجه به ماهیت متقابل اکثر معاملات، اغلب چنین نخواهد کرد - که قصد تحمیل ضرر اقتصادی را داشته باشد. از آنجا که آلفا و کوسیس در اینجا قصد انجام این کار را نداشتند، ادعا می‌کنند که محکومیت‌های آنها نامعتبر است.

ما قانع نشده‌ایم. نظریه تحریک متقلبانه هم با متن قانون کلاهبرداری سیمی و هم با سابقه ما که آن را تفسیر می‌کند، سازگار است. بنابراین، ما الزام ضرر اقتصادی پیشنهادی دادخواهان را رد می‌کنیم.

الف

با قانون شروع کنید. برای اینکه متهم به کلاهبرداری الکترونیکی مجرم شناخته شود، باید (1) «طرحی» (2) برای «به دست آوردن پول یا اموال» (3) «از طریق تظاهر، نمایش یا وعده‌های دروغین یا متقلبانه» (به عنوان مثال، ماده 1343) «تدبیر» یا «قصد» برای «تدبیر» داشته باشد. طرح اولیه ترغیب متقلبانه به وضوح هر یک از این عناصر قانونی را برآورده می‌کند. طبق این نظریه، متهم (1) «طرحی» (2) «تدبیر» می‌کند تا قربانی را به قراردادی برای «به دست آوردن» «پول یا اموال» (3) «از طریق تظاهرهای دروغین یا متقلبانه» (به عنوان مثال، «طرحی» (3) «ترغیب» کند». مهم نیست چقدر...وقتی به آن خیره می‌شویم، زبان کلی و عمومی ماده ۱۳۴۳ ما را در یافتن هرگونه مبنایی برای رد طرح تشویق متقلبانه با مشکل مواجه می‌کند.

به حقایق همین پرونده توجه کنید. با استفاده از مارکیاس به عنوان یک نهاد واسطه، شاکیان «طرحی» را برای به دست آوردن قراردادها از طریق رعایت ظاهری الزامات کسب و کار محروم PennDOT «تدارک» دیدند. همان. هدف آنها؟ «به دست آوردن پول» (ده‌ها میلیون دلار) از PennDOT. همان. و چگونه؟ با ارائه تعدادی «اظهارات دروغین یا متقلبانه...» - ابتدا در مورد برنامه‌هایشان برای به دست آوردن لوازم رنگ از مارکیاس و بعداً در مورد انجام دقیقاً همین کار. همان. ماده ۱۳۴۳ چیزی بیش از این نمی‌خواهد.

دیدگاه مخالف آلفا و کوسیس بر این فرض استوار است که اگر متهم چیزی - چه پول، چه ملک یا خدمات - با ارزش برابر در ازای آن ارائه دهد، یک طرح نمی‌تواند کلاهبرداری الکترونیکی محسوب شود. اما قانون خلاف این را می‌گوید. «به دست آوردن» چیزی به معنای «به دست آوردن یا تصاحب» آن است، معمولاً «از طریق یک اقدام یا روش برنامه‌ریزی‌شده». فرهنگ لغت بین‌المللی سوم وبستر ۱۵۵۹ (۲۰۰۲). یک چیز صرفاً به این دلیل که چیز دیگری همزمان در ازای آن داده می‌شود، «به دست آمده» است. یک مجموعه‌دار هنری که یک مجسمه نادر را به دست می‌آورد، می‌تواند به درستی بگوید که آن را «به دست آورده است»، صرف نظر از قیمت شش رقمی آن. و از آنجا که معنای «به دست آوردن» به ارزش اقلام مبادله شده بستگی ندارد، مجموعه‌دار هنری همچنان می‌تواند بگوید که مجسمه را «به دست آورده است» حتی اگر ارزش عینی قیمتی که پرداخت کرده را نداشته باشد. 
به طور خلاصه، قانون کلاهبرداری الکترونیکی در مورد ضرر اقتصادی بی‌تفاوت است. قانون حتی به ضرر اشاره‌ای نمی‌کند، چه برسد به اینکه آن را الزامی کند. در عوض، متهم با نقشه کشیدن برای «به دست آوردن» «پول یا دارایی قربانی»، صرف نظر از اینکه آیا به دنبال بدتر کردن وضعیت اقتصادی قربانی است یا خیر، ماده ۱۳۴۳ را نقض می‌کند. بنابراین، محکومیتی که بر اساس انگیزه متقلبانه بنا شده باشد، با ماده ۱۳۴۳ مطابقت دارد.

۲
آلفا و کوسیسیس با مقاومت در برابر این نتیجه‌گیری، ادعا می‌کنند که ضرر اقتصادی بخشی جدایی‌ناپذیر از درک عرفی از کلاهبرداری است، اصطلاحی که به دو شکل در قانون کلاهبرداری سیمی ظاهر می‌شود. ماده ۱۳۴۳ ("طرح یا حیله‌ای برای کلاهبرداری... با استفاده از ادعاهای دروغین یا متقلبانه" (تأکید اضافه شده است)). وقتی کنگره از اصطلاحی با ریشه در قانون عرفی استفاده می‌کند، ما عموماً فرض می‌کنیم که این اصطلاح "خاک قدیمی را با خود می‌آورد". سخار علیه ایالات متحده، ۵۷۰ U. S. ۷۲۹، ۷۳۳ (۲۰۱۳). همانطور که شاکیان خاطرنشان می‌کنند، ما مدت‌هاست که اصطلاح قانونی "کلاهبرداری" (و انواع آن) را به این شکل تفسیر کرده‌ایم - یعنی با ارجاع به ریشه آن در قانون عرفی. رجوع کنید به پرونده Neder v. United States، 527 U. S. 1, 21–22 (1999)؛ Universal Health Services, Inc. v. United States ex rel. Escobar، 579 U. S. 176, 187 (2016) ("اصطلاح "متقلبانه" نمونه‌ای بارز از یک اصطلاح قانونی است که معنای عرفی کلاهبرداری را در بر می‌گیرد").

با این حال، این اصل قدیمی فقط تا حدی اعمال می‌شود که یک اصطلاح عرفی "معنای ثابتی را انباشته کرده باشد." Neder، 527 U. S.، در صفحه 21؛ Kemp v. United States، 596 U. S. 528, 539 (2022). بنابراین، برای نشان دادن اینکه ضرر اقتصادی برای محکومیت کلاهبرداری فدرال ضروری است، آلفا و کوسیس باید نشان دهند که چنین ضرری به عنوان جزئی از کلاهبرداری عرفی "به طور گسترده پذیرفته شده" است. موریست علیه ایالات متحده، 342 U. S. 246, 263 (1952). آنها نمی‌توانند. 
در حقوق عرفی، «کلاهبرداری» اصطلاحی با دامنه‌ی گسترده بود. دادگاه‌ها به جای توافق بر سر یک شکل واحد از مسئولیت، حداقل سه مورد را به رسمیت شناختند و عناصر و راه‌حل‌های خاص به ماهیت آسیب ادعایی شاکی معطوف شدند. 
برای درک تفاوت این سه شکل، ممکن است در نظر گرفتن گونه‌ای از حقایق در اینجا مفید باشد. تصور کنید که PennDOT اندکی پس از شروع کار Alpha و Kousisis در پروژه‌های Girard Point و 30th Street، طرح دعوی خواهان‌ها را کشف می‌کرد. در چنین شرایطی، قانون و انصاف حداقل سه راه برای جبران خسارت فراهم می‌کرد: PennDOT می‌توانست (1) به دنبال فسخ قراردادها باشد؛ (2) موضوع را تحت عنوان جرم ادعاهای دروغین برای کیفرخواست ارجاع دهد؛ یا (3) علیه کلاهبرداران به دلیل خسارات وارده، اقامه‌ی دعوی شبه جرم کند.
اگر PennDOT می‌خواست قراردادهای آلوده به تقلب را فسخ کند، اکثر دادگاه‌ها از نظر تاریخی به آن اجازه می‌دادند که حتی بدون اثبات ضرر اقتصادی، این کار را انجام دهد. برای اخذ حکم فسخ، PennDOT فقط باید ثابت می‌کرد که «مالی با ماهیت یا شرایط متفاوت از آنچه وعده داده شده بود دریافت کرده است» («اگرچه ارزش برابر») یا، در اینجا مرتبط‌تر، اینکه معامله «کمتر از آنچه ادعا شده بود، سودمند بوده است» («اگرچه هیچ ضرر واقعی وجود نداشت»). W. Keeton, D. Dobbs, R. Keeton, & D. Owen, Prosser and Keeton on Law of Torts §110, p. 766 (5th ed. 1984) (Prosser & Keeton). به عبارت دیگر، بسیاری از دادگاه‌ها صرفاً به این دلیل که Alpha و Kousisis PennDOT را به معامله‌ای که اساساً متفاوت از معامله‌ای بود که وعده داده بودند، فریب داده بودند، حکم به فسخ می‌دادند. رجوع کنید به Hirschman v. Healy، 162 Minn. 328, 331, 202 N. W. 734, 735 (1925) («لازم به ذکر است که اثبات خسارات به دلار و سنت برای او ضروری نبود.»)«لغو یا فسخ قرارداد و یادداشت برای اظهارات نادرست»)؛ ویلیامز علیه کر، 152 Pa. 560, 565, 25 A. 618, 619 (1893)؛ اسپرکلز علیه گوریل، 152 Cal. 383, 391, 92 P. 1011, 1015 (1907). با قرض گرفتن خلاصه‌ای از بلک (از شهرت فرهنگ لغت حقوقی بلک)، بسیاری از «تصمیمات، قاعده‌ای را که مستلزم اثبات خسارت واقعی است، به طور کلی رد می‌کنند.» 1 اچ. بلک، فسخ قراردادها و لغو اسناد کتبی §112، صفحه 314 (1916).4
همان قاعده عدم الزام به ضرر با همان قدرت در مورد جرم ادعاهای دروغین اعمال می‌شد. همانطور که بسیاری از دادگاه‌ها معتقد بودند، جرم «زمانی کامل می‌شد که مال به طور متقلبانه به دست آمده باشد.» وست علیه ایالت، 63 نب. 257، 259، 88 شمال غربی. 503، 504 (1901)؛ همچنین رجوع کنید به کامنولث علیه کو، 115 ماساچوست. 481، 502-503 (1874)؛ پیپل علیه برایانت، 119 کال. 595، 597، 51 صفحه 960، 961 (1898)؛ کامنولث علیه فرگوسن، 135 کنتاکی. 32، 34، 121 جنوب غربی. 967، 968 (1909)؛ اف. بایرن، تظاهرهای دروغین و تقلب‌ها §II(7)، در 12 دایره‌المعارف حقوق آمریکایی و انگلیسی 835 (ویرایش‌های دی. گارلند، ال. مک‌گی، و جی. کاک‌کرافت، ویرایش دوم، 1899). و به دلیل اینکه «ضرر واقعی» لزوماً «دنباله‌دار نیست... اینکه کالاهای داده شده در مبادله‌ای که با ادعاهای دروغین تضمین شده، از نظر ارزش با کالاهای به دست آمده برابر باشند، بی‌اهمیت [بوده است]. 1 ای. مک‌کلین، حقوق جزا §680، صفحه 686 (1897). بنابراین، اگر کسی «تابلویی را بر اساس ادعای نادرست مبنی بر اینکه اثر یک نقاش برجسته است» خریداری کند، این واقعیت که «تابلو ارزشمند بوده است» فروشنده را از «جرم ادعای دروغین» مبرا نمی‌کند. بارتلت علیه ایالت، خیابان اوهایو 28، 669، 672 (1876). در چنین موردی، شاکی «واقعاً فریب خورده» بود، حتی اگر «متحمل ضرر مالی واقعی نشده بود». در مورد Rudebeck، 95 Wash. 433, 440, 163 P. 930, 933 (1917). 
رأی دیوان عالی ایالت مِین در پرونده‌ی State v. Mills گویا است. 17 Me. 211 (1840). در آنجا، صاحب اسب به خریدار بالقوه اظهار داشت که اسب «چارلی نامیده می‌شود»، اگرچه «او می‌دانست که این اسب، اسبی با این نام نیست.» همانجا (رساله). خریدار که متقاعد شده بود، «کره اسب و پنج دلار پول» خود را با اسب معاوضه کرد. همانجا. اما همانطور که خریدار به زودی فهمید، اسب «چارلی» نبود، اگرچه فروشنده ادعا کرد که «به خوبی یک اسب است» و «ارزشی برابر یا بیشتر» از کره اسب و پول دارد. همانجا، صفحه ۲۱۲. دادگاه، با رد اعتراضات متهم به حکم محکومیت، توضیح داد که این حقایق «به معنای واقعی کلمه در چارچوب» قانون ادعاهای دروغین است. همانجا، صفحه ۲۱۸ (نظر اکثریت). صدور حکم محکومیت بر اساس ادعاهای دروغین مستلزم اثبات ساده «این بود که یکی از ادعاهای [چنین] دروغین بوده و شخص آسیب‌دیده به این ترتیب وادار به ترک اموال خود شده است.» همان، صفحه ۲۱۷.

آلفا و کوسیسیس با در نظر گرفتن میلز به عنوان یک مورد استثنا، استدلال می‌کنند که دادگاه‌های کامن‌لا عموماً در صورتی که قربانی آسیب ندیده باشد، از رسیدگی به دعوی کلاهبرداری خودداری می‌کنند. از یک نظر، آنها درست می‌گویند: ما گفته‌ایم که کلاهبرداری تنها زمانی رخ می‌دهد که قربانی «واقعاً به خاطر آسیبش گمراه شده باشد». اسمیت علیه ریچاردز، 13 پت. 26، 39 (1839)؛ همچنین به کلارک علیه وایت، 12 پت. 178، 196 (1838) مراجعه کنید ("[یک] قصد متقلبانه صرف، بدون همراهی با هرگونه عمل زیانبار، موضوع آگاهی قضایی نیست" (تأکید اضافه شده است)). اما شاکیان با فرض اینکه ضرر اقتصادی به تنهایی می‌تواند این الزام "آسیب" حقوق عرفی را برآورده کند، این سوال را مطرح می‌کنند. همانطور که پرونده‌ها و رساله‌های مورد بحث در بالا تأیید می‌کنند، این محرومیت از اموال ناشی از فریب - نه ضرر اقتصادی - بود که دادگاه‌های حقوق عرفی عموماً آن را زیانبار می‌دانستند.5 به استیلول علیه رنکین، 55 مونت. 130، 135، 174 صفحه 186، 187 (1918) مراجعه کنید (دادگاه‌ها "به اشتباهاتی که منجر به آسیب نمی‌شوند، اهمیت نمی‌دهند؛ اما "آسیب" و "ضرر مالی" اصطلاحات مترادفی نیستند"). بنابراین، میلز چنین نیست. مورد استثنا. 
با این اوصاف، قانون متفاوتی در مورد جرم کلاهبرداری اعمال می‌شد. برای داشتن یک دلیل کامل برای طرح دعوی، شاکی باید "خسارت قابل توجهی متحمل شده باشد"؛ به عبارت دیگر، ضرر اقتصادی. Prosser & Keeton §110، در 765؛ به Butler v. Watkins, 13 Wall. 456, 464 (1872)؛ Dura Pharmaceuticals, Inc. v. Broudo, 544 U. S. 336, 343–344 (2005) مراجعه کنید (دعوی کلاهبرداری در حقوق عرفی مستلزم آن بود که شاکی نشان دهد "که متحمل ضرر اقتصادی واقعی شده است"). بنابراین، با بازگشت به حقایق اصلاح‌شده‌ای که در بالا معرفی شد، PennDOT نمی‌توانست ادعای خسارت کلاهبرداری را مطرح کند، مگر اینکه طرح Alpha و Kousisis باعث ضرر اقتصادی آن شده باشد. (شاید PennDOT از یک پیشنهاد کم‌هزینه‌تر صرف‌نظر کرده باشد، مثلاً یا فرآیند مناقصه را با هزینه قابل توجهی دوباره آغاز کرده باشد.)
صرف نظر از موارد، مواردی که شامل فریب می‌شوند، عمدتاً با سؤال مطرح‌شده در اینجا نامربوط هستند. دادگاه‌ها ضرر اقتصادی را نه به این دلیل که در ذات درک عرفی از کلاهبرداری بود، بلکه به این دلیل که یک دعوی مسئولیت مدنی برای فریب «به عنوان خسارت تلقی می‌شد» و بنابراین برای جبران ضرر اقتصادی شاکی طراحی شده بود، الزامی کردند. ایالات متحده علیه دان، 268 U. S. 121, 131 (1925)؛ رجوع کنید به G. McCleary, Damage as Requisite to Rescission for Misrepresentation, 36 Mich. L. Rev. 1, 17 (1937) (توصیف فسخ و خسارت به عنوان «دو رویکرد کاملاً متفاوت برایمشکل جبران خسارت ناشی از ارائه اطلاعات نادرست). بنابراین جای تعجب نیست که دادگاه‌ها از قربانیان فریب می‌خواستند «برای ایجاد حق جبران خسارت، خسارت را اثبات کنند». Dunn, 268 U. S., at 131.
به طور خلاصه، دادگاه‌های کامن‌لا به طور یکسان دعوایی را که به نظر کلاهبرداری می‌آمد، به توانایی شاکی در اثبات ضرر اقتصادی مشروط نمی‌کردند. به طور خاص‌تر، اگر دعوا برای فسخ یا پیگرد قانونی به دلیل ادعاهای دروغین بود، «جراحت» مورد نظر شاکی معمولاً نیازی به مالی بودن نداشت. این ناقوس مرگ اتکای آلفا و کوسیسیس به کامن‌لا را به صدا در می‌آورد. اصل خاک قدیمی در غیاب یک قاعده کاملاً جاافتاده اعمال نمی‌شود. Kemp, 596 U. S., at 539. به عنوان مثال، در پرونده Pasquantino v. United States، ما از خواندن «قانون کلاهبرداری سیمی به استثنای کلاهبرداری‌های معطوف به فرار از مالیات خارجی» خودداری کردیم زیرا قاعده کامن‌لا مربوطه «به وضوح چنین پیگرد قانونی را منع نمی‌کرد». 544 U. S. 349, 359–360 (2005). در اینجا نیز همینطور است: قانون عرفی یک قاعده کلی قابل اجرا مبنی بر اینکه همه شاکیان کلاهبرداری باید اقامه دعوی کرده و ضرر اقتصادی را اثبات کنند، وضع نکرده است، بنابراین ما چنین الزامی را در قانون کلاهبرداری سیمی نمی‌خوانیم.6 به همان، در صفحه 364 مراجعه کنید.

حتی آلفا و کوسیسیس اذعان می‌کنند که قانون عرفی در هر موردی ضرر اقتصادی را الزامی نکرده است. همانطور که آنها اذعان می‌کنند، اگر به شاکی «چیزی متفاوت از آنچه وعده داده شده بود» تحویل داده شود - حتی چیزی با ارزش معادل - یا اگر معامله «شامل کالایی با ویژگی‌های منحصر به فرد باشد»، آنگاه «عدم تحویل طبق وعده ممکن است کلاهبرداری در اموال محسوب شود». خلاصه پاسخ 15. وقتی در استدلال شفاهی تحت فشار قرار گرفتند، شاکیان به این سناریوها به عنوان «استثنا» اشاره کردند. ترجمه شفاهی ارگ. ۱۰. اما چند مثال نشان می‌دهد که چنین «استثنائی» چقدر راحت قانون را می‌بلعد. اگر کسی برای نقاشی از پدربزرگش قرارداد ببندد و در عوض پرتره‌ای از گروور کلیولند را تحویل دهد، به اصطلاح «استثناء» شاکیان مسلماً اعمال می‌شود. همان، صفحات ۹-۱۱. اگر یک تأمین‌کننده قول «سیب» بدهد اما در عوض «پرتقال» تحویل دهد، نیز همینطور. خلاصه پاسخ ۱۵. اما اگر این دو مثال استثنا باشند، چرا به جای یک شمش طلا به ارزش همان، یک توده زغال سنگ به ارزش یک میلیون دلار ارائه نشود؟ ترجمه شفاهی ارگ. ۲۸-۳۰. یا، دقیق‌تر، چرا خدماتی که با مواد یک تأمین‌کننده غیرمحروم انجام می‌شود، زمانی که دولت یک تأمین‌کننده محروم را درخواست کرده، ارائه نشود؟ دادخواست‌دهندگان هیچ راه اصولی برای تعیین مرز ارائه نمی‌دهند.

و هیچ راهی وجود ندارد، زیرا در سطح مناسب از دقت، هر چیزی را می‌توان به عنوان "منحصر به فرد" یا "متفاوت از" چیز دیگری توصیف کرد. از این گذشته، "حیوان"، "اسب"، "اسب سالم" و "اسبی به نام چارلی" همگی توصیفات دقیقی از ملک مورد معامله در میلز هستند. ۱۷ من، در صفحات ۲۱۲، ۲۱۶. تنها خاص‌ترین این توصیفات، "اسبی به نام چارلی"، ملک وعده داده شده را از ملک دریافتی متمایز می‌کند، با این حال دادگاه هنوز مشکلی در برچسب زدن این پرونده به عنوان "تظاهر دروغین [sic]، متقلبانه" نداشت. ساخته شده است." همان، در صفحه ۲۱۸.
به طور واضح، آلفا و کوسیس هیچ منبع معتبری را شناسایی نمی‌کنند که از تلقی منحصر به فرد بودن به عنوان نوعی استثنا بر قاعده عدم الزام به ضرر پشتیبانی کند. این احتمالاً به این دلیل است که حقوق عرفی مدت‌هاست که استاندارد متفاوتی - یعنی اهمیت - را به عنوان مبنای اصولی برای تمایز تحریف‌های روزمره از کلاهبرداری‌های قابل پیگیری پذیرفته است. چه در حقوق مسئولیت مدنی و چه در حقوق قراردادها، "اهمیت به تأثیر بر رفتار احتمالی یا واقعی دریافت‌کننده تحریف ادعایی نگاه می‌کند." خدمات بهداشت جهانی، 579 ایالات متحده، صفحه 193 (علامت‌های نقل قول داخلی حذف شده‌اند؛ تغییر در متن اصلی). با شباهت به یک استاندارد، اهمیت می‌پرسد که آیا ارائه نادرست «انگیزه یا انگیزه‌ای» برای ورود به یک معامله ایجاد کرده است یا خیر. اسمیت، 13 پت.، صفحه 39. یا، همانطور که در خدمات بهداشت جهانی توضیح دادیم، ارائه نادرست در صورتی اهمیت دارد که یک فرد معقول در تصمیم‌گیری در مورد نحوه اقدام به آن اهمیت دهد، یا اگر خوانده می‌دانست (یا باید می‌دانست) که گیرنده احتمالاً آن را مهم می‌داند. 579 ایالات متحده، صفحه 193 (با استناد به بازگویی (دوم) مسئولیت مدنی §538 (1976)؛ بازگویی (دوم) قراردادها §162(2) (1979)).7
در مقابل ما، طرفین در مورد جزئیات استاندارد اهمیت برای اهداف §1343 بحث می‌کنند. آلفا و کوسیس به نوبه خود ما را به معیار حقوق عرفی که همین الان توضیح داده شد - چیزی که آنها «معیار سنتی اهمیت» می‌نامند. خلاصه پاسخ ۱۸-۲۱. در مقابل، دولت یک معیار ماهیت معامله را پیشنهاد می‌کند که بر اساس آن، ارائه اطلاعات نادرست تنها در صورتی مهم است که به «ماهیت» معامله طرفین مربوط باشد. خدمات بهداشت جهانی، ۵۷۹ ایالات متحده، در ۱۹۴، شماره ۵ (به نقل از Junius Constr. Corp. v. Cohen، ۲۵۷ N. Y. ۳۹۳، ۴۰۰، ۱۷۸ N. E. ۶۷۲، ۶۷۴ (۱۹۳۱))؛ به خلاصه برای ایالات متحده ۴۳-۴۵ مراجعه کنید. با این حال، ما نیازی به حل و فصل بحث در اینجا نداریم، زیرا آلفا و کوسیس به مهم بودن اظهارات نادرست خود اعتراض نکرده‌اند. در حال حاضر، کافی است که تکرار کنیم «اهمیت دروغ، عنصری از» - و بنابراین محدودیتی برای - قوانین کلاهبرداری فدرال است. ندر، ۵۲۷ ایالات متحده، در ۲۵. محکومیتی مبتنی برنظریه‌ی تحریک متقلبانه بدون آن قابل دفاع نیست.

ب
دادخواهان اصرار دارند که رویه قضایی ما نظریه‌ی تحریک متقلبانه را رد می‌کند، اما آنها اشتباه می‌کنند: ما دو بار این استدلال را که محکومیت به کلاهبرداری به ضرر اقتصادی بستگی دارد، رد کرده‌ایم. ما این کار را ابتدا در پرونده‌ی کارپنتر علیه ایالات متحده انجام دادیم، پرونده‌ای که در آن متهمان بارها محتوای ستون سرمایه‌گذاری یک روزنامه را فاش کرده بودند. 484 U. S. 19, 23 (1987). اگرچه این طرح باعث «ضرر مالی» روزنامه نشد، اما به نظر ما کافی بود که روزنامه «از حق استفاده‌ی انحصاری» از اطلاعات اختصاصی خود محروم شده باشد. همان، در صفحه 26. سپس، در پرونده‌ی شاو علیه ایالات متحده، ما محکومیت تحت قانون کلاهبرداری بانکی را تأیید کردیم، حتی اگر «هیچ بانکی که در این طرح دخیل بوده» «هیچ ضرر مالی متحمل نشده باشد». 580 U. S. 63, 67 (2016). ما توضیح دادیم که این قانون «نه اثبات ضرر مالی نهایی و نه اثبات قصد ایجاد ضرر مالی را الزامی نمی‌کند.» همان. 
با این حال، آلفا و کوسیس ادعا می‌کنند که نظریه‌ی تحریک متقلبانه با سایر جنبه‌های رویه قضایی ما در تضاد است. اولاً، آنها استدلال می‌کنند که این نظریه، محکومیت به کلاهبرداری را بر اساس دخالت صرف در «قدرت حاکمیتی ایالت برای تنظیم مقررات» مجاز می‌داند. کلی، ۵۹۰ ایالات متحده، در صفحه ۴۰۱ (به نقل از کلیولند، ۵۳۱ ایالات متحده، در صفحه ۲۳). اما اینطور نیست. صرف نظر از نظریه‌ی زیربنایی کلاهبرداری، ماده‌ی ۱۳۴۳ ایجاب می‌کند که «پول یا اموال» موضوع طرح کلاهبردار بوده باشد. به ۵۹۰ ایالات متحده، در صفحه ۳۹۳ مراجعه کنید. بنابراین اگر طرح، طرحی برای تغییر اعمال قدرت نظارتی باشد - مثلاً با فریب دولت برای واگذاری مجوز بازی - نظریه‌ی تحریک متقلبانه نقشی ندارد. رجوع کنید به کلیولند، ۵۳۱ ایالات متحده، صفحات ۲۳-۲۴. اما اگر، مانند اینجا، کلاهبردار به دنبال وادار کردن دولت به انتقال پول یا اموال خود باشد، این ضرر برای حفظ محکومیت کلاهبرداری کافی است. این ضرر، آنطور که شاکیان استدلال می‌کنند، صرفاً «محصول جانبی تصادفی» طرحی برای دستکاری در اعمال قدرت نظارتی نیست. کلی، ۵۹۰ ایالات متحده، صفحه ۴۰۳. اگر چیزی وجود داشته باشد، عکس آن معمولاً صادق است: در جریان طرح‌های ترغیب متقلبانه، تضعیف منافع نظارتی دولت صرفاً «یک محصول جانبی تصادفی (حتی اگر پیش‌بینی شده)» از به دست آوردن پول یا اموال آن است. رجوع کنید به همان. به عنوان مثال، در اینجا، آلفا و کوسیس پول را در نظر داشتند. هیچ چیز نشان نمی‌دهد که آنها طرح خود را با هدف خنثی کردن ابتکار عمل PennDOT در مورد کسب و کارهای محروم ابداع کرده باشند. چنین نتیجه‌ای در پایین دست «هدف» آنها برای پر کردن جیب‌هایشان بود. همانجا؛ همچنین به 82 F. 4th، در صفحه 240 مراجعه کنید.

الزام پول یا دارایی همچنین توضیح می‌دهد که چرا نظریه ترغیب متقلبانه، همانطور که شاکیان معتقدند، "تمایز کنگره" بین قانون کلاهبرداری الکترونیکی و قوانینی که توطئه برای کلاهبرداری از ایالات متحده را ممنوع می‌کنند، به 18 U. S. C. §371، و اظهارات نادرست یا متقلبانه در امور فدرال، به §1001 مراجعه کنید، "از بین نمی‌برد". خلاصه برای شاکیان 27. از آنجا که این قوانین اخیر محدود به طرح‌هایی برای "به دست آوردن پول یا دارایی" نیستند، فراتر از آنچه نظریه ترغیب متقلبانه می‌تواند به آن برسد، گسترش می‌یابند. §1343. به United States v. Ressam، 553 U. S. 272, 274 (2008) مراجعه کنید (توصیف محکومیت تحت §1001 برای ارائه "اظهارات نادرست به یک مقام گمرکی" برای ورود به ایالات متحده). بنابراین، ترغیب متقلبانه نمی‌تواند هر دروغی را که طبق ماده ۳۷۱ و ماده ۱۰۰۱ قابل مجازات است، به جرم کلاهبرداری تبدیل کند که مجازات احتمالی آن ۲۰ سال حبس است.

همچنین این نظریه، سابقه ما را که - گذشته از استثنای خدمات صادقانه - ماده ۱۳۴۳ «از منافع ناملموس غیرمرتبط با حقوق مالکیت سنتی محافظت نمی‌کند» تضعیف نمی‌کند. Ciminelli، ۵۹۸ U. S.، در صفحه ۳۱۲. همانطور که قبلاً بحث شد، یک متهم فقط در صورتی مرتکب کلاهبرداری الکترونیکی می‌شود که طرح او «با هدف محروم کردن» قربانی از یک منفعت مالکیت سنتی باشد. Kelly، ۵۹۰ U. S.، در صفحه ۴۰۰؛ همچنین به Ciminelli، ۵۹۸ U. S.، در صفحه ۳۰۹ مراجعه کنید. اگر این طرح به جای آن، نوعی منفعت ناملموس - مثلاً منفعت یک شهروند در «دولت بی‌طرف» - را هدف قرار داده باشد، نظریه ترغیب متقلبانه قابل اجرا نیست. McNally، 483 U. S.، صفحه 355.
در نهایت، نظریه تحریک متقلبانه «بازسازی» نظریه حق کنترل نیست. خلاصه پاسخ 11. در پرونده Ciminelli، ما نظریه اخیر را رد کردیم، که معتقد است اصطلاح «دارایی» در ماده 1343 شامل «حق کنترل استفاده از دارایی‌های فرد» می‌شود. 598 U. S.، صفحه 311. طبق این تعریف سختگیرانه از «دارایی»، متهم صرفاً با «نقشه کشیدن برای محروم کردن قربانی از اطلاعات اقتصادی بالقوه ارزشمند لازم برای تصمیم‌گیری‌های اقتصادی اختیاری»، ماده 1343 را نقض می‌کند. همان، صفحه 310. ما معتقدیم که چنین طرحی، هیچ «منافع مالکیت سنتی» را در بر نمی‌گیرد. همان، صفحه ۳۱۶.
برخلاف نظریه حق کنترل، انگیزه متقلبانه «صرف اطلاعات را به عنوان منافع محافظت‌شده» در نظر نمی‌گیرد. همان، صفحه ۳۱۵. بلکه، از پول و دارایی محافظت می‌کند. و هیچ‌کدام از گفته‌های ما در پرونده سیمینلی با نظر ما در اینجا مغایرت ندارد. اگرچه دولت از ما خواست که محکومیت سیمینلی را بر اساس یک دلیل جایگزین - یعنی نظریه انگیزه متقلبانه - تأیید کنیم.ما از انجام این کار خودداری کردیم زیرا این امر ما را ملزم می‌کرد که «نه تنها وظیفه دادگاه بدوی، بلکه وظیفه هیئت منصفه را نیز بر عهده بگیریم». همان، صفحه ۳۱۷. ما نظریه تحریک متقلبانه را مورد بحث قرار ندادیم، چه رسد به رد آن. به همان، صفحه ۳۱۷-۳۱۸ (ALITO, J., concurring) مراجعه کنید (با توجه به اینکه دادگاه در مورد این نظریه به «توانایی دولت برای محاکمه مجدد شاکی» نپرداخته است).

III
آلفا و کوسیس در مورد عواقبی که در صورت تأیید نظریه تحریک متقلبانه به دنبال خواهد داشت، هشدار می‌دهند. آنها می‌گویند: «طبق این نظریه، هر گونه ارائه اطلاعات نادرست عمدی که برای ترغیب کسی به معامله اموال طراحی شده باشد، کلاهبرداری در اموال محسوب می‌شود.» خلاصه برای شاکیان ۴۰. از نظر آنها، این نتیجه اخطار منصفانه را تهدید می‌کند و با تجاوز به اختیارات پلیس ایالت‌ها، به شدت با اصول فدرالیسم در تضاد است. همان، صفحه ۳۸-۳۹.

ما متقاعد نشده‌ایم. الزام «مهم» به میزان قابل توجهی دامنه‌ی تحریف‌های قابل پیگیری را محدود می‌کند. خدمات بهداشت جهانی، 579 ایالات متحده، در صفحه 194. و مرزهای نظریه‌ی ترغیب متقلبانه آنقدر مبهم نیست که خطر تجاوز به اقتدار ایالت‌ها یا «ایجاد تله» برای «افراد بی‌احتیاط» را به همراه داشته باشد. اسنایدر علیه ایالات متحده، 603 ایالات متحده، 1، 15 (2024). بلکه، این نظریه نوع خاصی از کلاهبرداری را جرم‌انگاری می‌کند: دروغ گفتن عمدی برای وادار کردن قربانی به معامله‌ای که برای او هزینه مالی یا مالی خواهد داشت. همانطور که قاضی لرند هند بیان کرد، «[یک] مرد، زمانی که با کلاهبرداری وادار به واگذاری دارایی خود می‌شود، به هر حال از دارایی خود فریب خورده است، زیرا در ازای آن، چیزی با ارزش برابر دریافت می‌کند.» ایالات متحده علیه رو، 56 F. 2d 747, 749 (CA2 1932).
«زبان قانون کلاهبرداری سیمی» بدون شک «گسترده» است. پاسکوانتینو، ۵۴۴ ایالات متحده، صفحه ۳۷۲. اما کنگره قانون کلاهبرداری سیمی را تصویب کرد و تغییر آن - در صورت تمایل - به عهده کنگره است.

*  *  *
تشویق متقلبانه «مدت‌هاست که به عنوان گونه‌ای از کلاهبرداری قابل پیگیری در نظر گرفته می‌شود.» ایالات متحده علیه فلدمن، ۹۳۱ F. 3d 1245, 1270 (CA11 2019) (پرایر، جی.، موافق). از آنجا که حکم دادگاه حوزه سوم با ماده ۱۳۴۳ مطابقت دارد، ما آن را تأیید می‌کنیم.

این حکم صادر شده است. ________________________________________

1 حداقل در مورد این حقایق، وزارت حمل و نقل هیچ جایی برای ابهام باقی نگذاشته است: یک کسب و کار محروم «اگر نقشش محدود به یک شرکت‌کننده اضافی در یک معامله، قرارداد یا پروژه‌ای باشد که از طریق آن وجوهی برای به دست آوردن ظاهر» مشارکت کسب و کار محروم منتقل می‌شود، عملکرد تجاری مفیدی انجام نمی‌دهد.» §26.55(c)(2).

2 اگرچه مک‌نالی قانون کلاهبرداری پستی، §1341، را درگیر کرد، «ما در قوانین کلاهبرداری سیمی و پستی به صورت نسبی زبان یکسانی را تفسیر کرده‌ایم.» Ciminelli v. United States, 598 U. S. 306, 312, n. 2 (2023); see Kelly v. United States, 590 U. S. 391, 398 (2020).

3 در پاسخ به تصمیم ما در پرونده مک‌نالی، کنگره قانون را اصلاح کرد تا طرح‌هایی را که به دنبال «محروم کردن دیگری از حق ناملموس خدمات صادقانه» هستند، شامل شود. ماده 1346؛ همچنین به کلیولند، 531 ایالات متحده، در صفحات 19-20 (که این تاریخچه را شرح می‌دهد) مراجعه کنید. این استثنا در اینجا بی‌ربط است.

4 مطمئناً، برخی دادگاه‌ها مسائل را متفاوت دیدند. به 1 بلک، فسخ قراردادها، ماده 112، در صفحات 312-313 مراجعه کنید. اما از آنجا که آلفا و کوسیس باید نشان دهند که الزام ضرر اقتصادی «قبل از انتقال» اصطلاح «کلاهبرداری» به ماده 1343 «به خوبی حل و فصل شده» است، هرگونه اختلاف نظر بین دادگاه‌ها بیشتر تأیید می‌کند که اصل خاک قدیمی اعمال نمی‌شود. کمپ علیه ایالات متحده، 596 ایالات متحده، 528، 539 (2022).

5 قاضی گورساچ معتقد است که ما «قاعده تاریخی آسیب کلاهبرداری را رد کرده‌ایم». پست، در صفحه 2 (نظر موافق تا حدی و موافق در حکم). با احترام، او اشتباه می‌کند. همه موافقند که «در حقوق عرفی، کلاهبرداری مستلزم اثبات آسیب دیدن قربانی بود.» همان. اما همانطور که دیوان عالی پنسیلوانیا در پرونده ویلیامز علیه کر بیان کرد، «آسیب» زمانی رخ داده است که یک کلاهبردار «با ارائه نادرست واقعیتی که آن را مهم می‌داند، از مالک، اموالی را به دست می‌آورد که در غیر این صورت با شرایطی که به این ترتیب وادار به پذیرش آن می‌شود، از آن جدا نمی‌شد.» 152 Pa. 560, 565, 25 A. 618, 619 (1893); همچنین رجوع کنید به MacLaren v. Cochran, 44 Minn. 255, 258, 46 N. W. 408, 410 (1890) («اگر یکی از طرفین با ارائه اظهارات متقلبانه در مورد واقعیتی که آن را مهم می‌داند و حق دارد به آن استناد کند، وادار به انعقاد قرارداد شود... نباید از طرف خاطی شنیده شود که بگوید هیچ آسیب واقعی نمی‌تواند از واقعیت ارائه شده به صورت نادرست ناشی شود»)؛ Carlisle v. State, 76 Ala. 75, 77 (1884) («تنها آسیبی که می‌تواند «با هرگونه تظاهر یا نشان دروغین» وارد شود، که توسط آن یک شخص «از دیگری پول یا سایر اموال شخصی را به دست می‌آورد»، فریبی است که بر اعتماد آن شخص تحمیل می‌شود»)؛ 1 E. McClain, Criminal Law §680, p. 686 (1897) ("به دست آوردن پول یا اموال است که ارتکاب کلاهبرداری محسوب می‌شود"). و به هیچ وجه، به رسمیت شناختن این تعریف عرفی توسط ما صرفاً یک "جمله‌ی کلیشه‌ای" نیست. پست، در 10 (نظر گورساچ، جی.). بلکه، برای اعتقاد ما ضروری است. رد اینکه ضرر مالی عنصری از کلاهبرداری است، به معنای پذیرش آن است - همانطور که عرفی می‌تواند...مدت‌هاست که گفته می‌شود کلاهبرداری زمانی کامل است که متهم با ادعاهای دروغین، باعث محرومیت از پول یا اموال شده باشد.

6 الزام پیشنهادی قاضی گورساچ برای جبران خسارت نیز تقریباً از همین مشکل رنج می‌برد. او عمدتاً به مواردی تکیه می‌کند که شامل سایر عناصر کلاهبرداری در حقوق عرفی - یعنی دروغ و قصد کلاهبرداری - می‌شوند. به پست، در صفحه ۴ (نظر موافق تا حدی و موافق در حکم) مراجعه کنید (با استناد به پرونده ایالت علیه کاسپرسون، ۷۱ یوتا ۶۸، ۷۵، ۲۶۲ صفحات ۲۹۴، ۲۹۶ (۱۹۲۷) (کذب)؛ ایالت علیه اشر، ۵۰ آرک، ۴۲۷، ۴۳۰-۴۳۱، ۸ اس. دبلیو. ۱۷۷، ۱۷۸ (۱۸۸۸) (کذب)؛ رکس علیه ویلیامز، ۷ کار. و پی. ۳۵۴، ۱۷۳ قانون نمایندگان انگلستان، ۱۵۸ (ان. پی. ۱۸۳۶) (کولریج، جی.) (قصد کلاهبرداری)؛ مردم علیه بیکر، ۹۶ نیویورک ۳۴۰، ۳۴۷-۳۴۸ (۱۸۸۴) (قصد کلاهبرداری)؛ مردم علیه ویکلی، ۶۲ میشیگان ۲۹۷، ۳۰۰-۳۰۳، 28 N. W. 871, 872–873 (1886) (هر دو)). و در مورد پرونده State v. Palmer، 50 Kan. 318, 32 P. 29 (1893)، حتی دیوان عالی کانزاس گفته است که «جراحت را تعریف نکرده است.» پرونده State v. Schultz، 252 Kan. 819, 848, 850 P. 2d 818, 837 (1993). قاضی گورساچ همچنین به مجموعه‌ای از پرونده‌های دادگاه‌های تجدیدنظر اشاره می‌کند. به پست، در 5 (نظر موافق تا حدی و موافق در حکم) مراجعه کنید. اما از آنجا که این پرونده‌ها پس از تصویب قانون کلاهبرداری سیمی (بسیاری از آنها چندین دهه) وضع شده‌اند، هر قاعده‌ای که آنها بیان می‌کنند - حتی با فرض اینکه منسجم باشد - نمی‌تواند اصل خاک قدیمی را برآورده کند. بنابراین، الزام آسیب قاضی گورساچ نه بر خاک «به خوبی ته نشین شده» بلکه بر شن‌های روان استوار است. کمپ، ۵۹۶ ایالات متحده، در صفحه ۵۳۹.

۷ در حالی که قاضی گورساچ به درستی اشاره می‌کند که ارزیابی اینکه آیا یک ارائه نادرست «همیشه ساده نخواهد بود»، پست، در صفحه ۹ (نظر موافق تا حدی و موافق در قضاوت)، او این نکته را نادیده می‌گیرد که «اهمیت بر اساس یک استاندارد عینی قضاوت می‌شود»، Amgen Inc. v. Connecticut Retirement Plans and Trust Funds، ۵۶۸ ایالات متحده ۴۵۵، ۴۵۹ (۲۰۱۳). این در مورد الزام آسیب پیشنهادی او صادق نیست. همانطور که مثال «اسبی به نام چارلی» نشان می‌دهد، اینکه آیا یک قربانی «دقیقاً همان چیزی را که برای آن پول داده است، دریافت کرده است» اغلب به نظر بیننده بستگی دارد. پست، در صفحه ۶ (نظر گورساچ، جی.) (تأکید اضافه شده است).

[۲۲ مه ۲۰۲۵]

قاضی توماس، موافق. 
دادخواست‌دهندگان استاماتیوس کوسیسیس و شرکت نقاشی و ساخت‌وساز آلفا، از دادگاه درخواست می‌کنند که الزام ضرر اقتصادی را به قانون فدرال کلاهبرداری سیمی، ۱۸ U. S. C. §۱۳۴۳، اضافه کند. دادگاه به درستی این درخواست را رد می‌کند و من به طور کامل به نظر آن می‌پیوندم.
من جداگانه می‌نویسم تا به موضوعی بپردازم که دادگاه آن را محفوظ می‌دارد: اینکه آیا اظهارات نادرست شاکیان «اساسی» و بنابراین قابل پیگیری طبق ماده ۱۳۴۳ بوده است یا خیر. وقتی دولت یک متهم را به دلیل کلاهبرداری بانکی تحت نظریه انگیزه متقلبانه تحت پیگرد قانونی قرار می‌دهد، الزام «اساسی بودن» «مبانی اصولی برای تشخیص اظهارات نادرست روزمره از کلاهبرداری قابل پیگیری» را فراهم می‌کند. قبل، در ۱۵. از آنجا که شاکیان «اعتراض نکرده‌اند که اظهارات نادرست آنها اساسی بوده است»، دادگاه امروز فرصتی برای طرح این موضوع ندارد. قبل، در ۱۶. اما، من شک دارم که اظهارات نادرست شاکیان اساسی بوده باشد.


شکایت‌کنندگان با وزارت حمل و نقل پنسیلوانیا (PennDOT) برای مرمت دو ملک در فیلادلفیا، پل گیرارد پوینت و ایستگاه خیابان سی‌ام، قراردادهایی منعقد کردند. هدف از قرارداد پل گیرارد پوینت «حفظ پل گیرارد پوینت» بود. App. ۱۰۸. قرارداد ایستگاه خیابان سی‌ام هدف مشابهی داشت: «[بهسازی]پل‌ها». همان، صفحه ۱۶۹. برای دستیابی به این اهداف، قراردادها مستلزم نقاشی، تعمیرات سازه‌های فولادی، بازسازی جاده‌ها و سایر پروژه‌های ساختمانی متفرقه بودند.

قراردادهای این دو کار در مجموع بیش از هزار صفحه بود و تعهدات نظارتی، فنی و اخلاقی متعددی را تحمیل می‌کرد. از جمله موارد دیگر، توافق‌نامه‌ها از درخواست‌کنندگان می‌خواستند که از قانون جبران خسارت کارگران ۱۹۱۵ پیروی کنند؛ از «مقررات خاص خرید آمریکا» پیروی کنند که درخواست‌کنندگان را ملزم به استفاده از فولاد و آهن تولید شده در ایالات متحده می‌کرد؛ به طور کلی از استفاده از «مواد تولید شده توسط کار محکومین» خودداری کنند؛ و «بر اساس نژاد، رنگ، ملیت یا جنسیت تبعیض قائل نشوند». به عنوان مثال، به App. مراجعه کنید. 112، 114، 117–119، 173، 175.
این قراردادها همچنین از درخواست‌کنندگان می‌خواستند «الزامات مربوط به بخش 26 از 49 C.F.R.» را اجرا کنند، همان، در صفحات 114، 175 (تأکید حذف شده است)، که برنامه بنگاه‌های اقتصادی محروم (DBE) دولت فدرال را اجرا می‌کند. برنامه DBE «گسترده‌ترین برنامه پیمانکاری فدرال مبتنی بر وضعیت» دولت است. D. Bernstein, The Modern American Law of Race, 94 S. Cal. L. Rev. 171, 208 (2021) (Bernstein). این برنامه که در سال 1983 تأسیس شد، هدفی را تعیین می‌کند که حداقل 10 pیک درصد از بودجه فدرال مجاز برای هر برنامه بزرگراه و حمل و نقل «با کسب و کارهای کوچکی که متعلق به و تحت کنترل افراد محروم اجتماعی و اقتصادی هستند، هزینه شود.» قانون کمک به حمل و نقل سطحی سال ۱۹۸۲، بند ۹۶ قانون ۲۱۰۰. طبق مقررات وزارت حمل و نقل (DOT)، یک کسب و کار کوچک در صورتی واجد شرایط DBE است که «حداقل ۵۱ درصد آن متعلق به یک یا چند فرد محروم اجتماعی و اقتصادی باشد» و «توسط یک یا چند نفر از افراد محروم اجتماعی و اقتصادی که مالک آن هستند، مدیریت و کنترل شود». ۴۹ CFR §۲۶.۵ (۲۰۲۴). 
وزارت حمل و نقل اصطلاح «محروم اجتماعی و اقتصادی» را در درجه اول بر اساس نژاد و جنسیت تعریف می‌کند. این برنامه «به طور انکارناپذیری فرض می‌کند» که هر عضوی از نژادهای خاص برشمرده شده «به دلیل هویت خود به عنوان عضوی از یک گروه، در معرض تعصب نژادی یا قومی یا تعصب فرهنگی در جامعه آمریکا قرار گرفته است» و بنابراین به عنوان «فرد محروم اجتماعی و اقتصادی» واجد شرایط شناخته می‌شود. همانجا. در میان گروه‌هایی که به طور فرضی واجد شرایط مزایای DBE هستند، «آمریکایی‌های سیاه‌پوست»، «آمریکایی‌های اسپانیایی‌تبار»، «آمریکایی‌های بومی»، «آمریکایی‌های آسیایی-اقیانوسیه» و «آمریکایی‌های آسیایی شبه‌قاره» قرار دارند. همانجا. برنامه DBE همچنین این فرض مساعد را برای زنان فراهم می‌کند. همانجا. گواهی‌دهندگان DBE «ممکن است ادعاهای عضویت گروهی را به عنوان یک امر بدیهی زیر سوال نبرند.» §26.67(a)(3). بنابراین، «[در] عمل، گواهی شدن به عنوان یک «اقلیت» برای دریافت وضعیت فرضی به عنوان مالک یک کسب‌وکار محروم واجد شرایط ترجیحات، در درجه اول بر اساس قانون افتخار عمل می‌کند، زیرا اطلاعات به ندرت تأیید می‌شوند.» برنشتاین ۲۲۳.
در حالی که افراد حذف‌شده از فهرست گروه‌های دارای محرومیت فرضی وزارت حمل‌ونقل ممکن است «تلاش کنند» محرومیت کافی را اثبات کنند، §26.67(d)(1)، روند درخواست «یک مانع بزرگ» است، Mid-America Milling Co., LLC v. United States Dept. of Transp., 2024 WL 4267183, *9 (ED Ky., September. 23, 2024). به عنوان مثال، «[یک] مرد سفیدپوست که ادعا می‌کند تبعیض شغلی را تجربه کرده است» باید یک «روایت شخصی» دقیق ارائه دهد که شواهدی ارائه دهد مبنی بر اینکه «وضعیت شغلی و/یا فرصت‌های محدود او برای کسب درآمد ناشی از اقدامات خاص تبعیض‌آمیز علیه او به دلیل [ویژگی متمایز عینی] است.» §26.67(d). 
PennDOT اهداف DBE را در هر دو قرارداد مورد بحث در این پرونده گنجانده است، و همانطور که اکثریت توضیح می‌دهند، دادخواست‌دهندگان انطباق خود را با آن مفاد نادرست نشان داده‌اند. رجوع کنید به مقدمه، در صفحه ۳. دولت شاکیان را طبق ماده ۱۸ قانون ایالات متحده آمریکا، بخش ۱۳۴۳، به اتهام انگیزه متقلبانه تحت پیگرد قانونی قرار داد. مقدمه، در صفحه ۱. هیئت منصفه محکوم شد و شاکی کوسیس به نزدیک به شش سال زندان محکوم شد.

II
اگرچه دادگاه مسئله اهمیت را به دلیل اینکه در اینجا مورد اعتراض قرار نگرفته بود، به روز دیگری موکول می‌کند، مقدمه، در صفحات ۱۵-۱۶، اهمیت عنصری است که دولت باید در هرگونه پیگرد قانونی فدرال در مورد کلاهبرداری سیمی آن را رعایت کند. رجوع کنید به پرونده Neder علیه ایالات متحده، ۵۲۷ ایالات متحده آمریکا، ۱، ۲۵ (۱۹۹۹). دولت استدلال می‌کند که معیار اهمیت در این زمینه، همان چیزی است که دادگاه در پرونده Universal Health Services, Inc. علیه ایالات متحده آمریکا در پرونده ex rel. بیان کرده است. اسکوبار، 579 ایالات متحده 176 (2016) - اینکه آیا یک ارائه نادرست به «اصل معامله» منجر شده است یا خیر، خلاصه برای ایالات متحده 43 (به نقل از خدمات بهداشت جهانی، 579 ایالات متحده، در صفحه 194، شماره 5). من به طور جدی شک دارم که مقررات DBE بتواند این استاندارد را برآورده کند.


خدمات بهداشت جهانی این سوال را مطرح کرد که آیا «متهم فقط در صورتی باید با مسئولیت قانون ادعاهای دروغین روبرو شود که نتواند نقض یک ماده قراردادی، قانونی یا نظارتی را که دولت صریحاً شرط پرداخت را تعیین کرده است، افشا کند.» همان، در صفحه 190. در حالی که ما این محدودیت را رد کردیم، تأکید کردیم که «ارائه نادرست در مورد رعایت یک الزام قانونی، نظارتی یا قراردادی باید برای تصمیم پرداخت دولت مهم باشد تا قابل پیگیری باشد» طبق قانون ادعاهای دروغین (FCA). همان، صفحه ۱۹۲.
ما همچنین مشاهده کردیم که «[طبق] هر برداشتی از این مفهوم، اهمیت «به تأثیر بر رفتار احتمالی یا واقعی دریافت‌کننده‌ی اظهارات نادرست ادعایی» نگاه می‌کند. «همان، صفحه ۱۹۳ (به نقل از ۲۶ آر. لرد، ویلیستون در مورد قراردادها §۶۹:۱۲، صفحه ۵۴۹ (ویرایش چهارم ۲۰۰۳) (ویلیستون)). در انعقاد قرارداد به طور خاص، «[یک] اظهارات نادرست تنها در صورتی مهم است که «احتمالاً... یک فرد معقول را به ابراز رضایت خود وادار کند»، یا خوانده «بداند که به دلایلی خاص [اظهار نظر] احتمالاً دریافت‌کننده‌ی خاص را به ابراز رضایت خود» به معامله وادار کند.» 579 U. S.، در صفحه 193 (به نقل از Restatement (Second) of Contracts §162(2) و Comment c، صفحات 439، 441 (1979)). بنابراین، توضیح دادیم که برای اینکه یک شرط قرارداد، اساسی باشد، باید به «ماهیت معامله» مربوط باشد. 579 U. S.، در صفحه 194، شماره 5 (به نقل از Junius Constr. Co. v. Cohen، 257 N. Y. 393، 400، 178 N. E. 672، 674 (1931))؛ همچنین رجوع کنید به 23 Williston §63:3، صفحه 483 (ویرایش چهارم 2018) (اهمیت «به ریشه توافق طرفین می‌رود» و «به جنبه‌های جالب آن می‌پردازد»)«هدف اساسی قرارداد»).
این تحقیق در مورد اهمیت صرفاً بر اساس برچسب‌های قرارداد انجام نمی‌شود. حتی در مواجهه با عبارات متضاد قرارداد، «اهمیت را نمی‌توان در جایی که عدم رعایت جزئی یا غیراساسی است، یافت.» خدمات بهداشت جهانی، 579 ایالات متحده، در صفحه 194. اقدامات یک طرف ممکن است نشان دهد که یک شرط قرارداد، حتی اگر عبارت قرارداد خلاف آن را نشان دهد، مهم نیست. به عنوان مثال، «اگر دولت مرتباً نوع خاصی از ادعا را به طور کامل پرداخت کند، علیرغم آگاهی واقعی از نقض الزامات خاص، و هیچ تغییری در موضع خود نشان نداده باشد، این شواهد محکمی است که الزامات مهم نیستند.» همان، صفحه ۱۹۵.
با اعمال این اصول «آشنا و دقیق»، همان، شماره ۶، ما روشن کردیم که الزامات نظارتی در یک قرارداد به طور خودکار مهم نیستند. بنابراین، ما ادعای دولت را رد کردیم که اگر «برای خدمات بهداشتی قرارداد ببندد و الزامی اضافه کند که پیمانکاران منگنه‌های ساخت آمریکا را خریداری کنند، هر کسی که برای آن خدمات ادعایی ارائه دهد اما استفاده از منگنه‌های خارجی را فاش نکند، قانون ادعاهای نادرست را نقض می‌کند.» همان، صفحه ۱۹۵-۱۹۶. این منطق به این معنی بود که «اگر دولت از پیمانکاران می‌خواست که انطباق خود را با کل قانون ایالات متحده و قانون مقررات فدرال تأیید کنند،... عدم ذکر عدم انطباق با هر یک از این الزامات همیشه مهم خواهد بود.» همان، صفحه ۱۹۶. ما توضیح دادیم که FCA «چنین دیدگاه فوق‌العاده گسترده‌ای از مسئولیت را اتخاذ نمی‌کند.» همانجا1
دادگاه این سوال را که آیا استاندارد اهمیت در زمینه FCA با استانداردی که در مورد پیگردهای کلاهبرداری سیمی اعمال می‌شود، یکسان است یا خیر، به تعویق انداخت، و من در اینجا هیچ نظر قطعی در مورد این سوال ابراز نمی‌کنم. اما، استانداردی که ما در خدمات بهداشت جهانی بیان کردیم، استانداردی "آشنا" بود که با رساله‌های معتبر و حقوق عرفی همسو بود. همانجا، در 195، شماره 6. و، به ویژه با توجه به تأیید دولت، به خلاصه‌ای برای ایالات متحده 43 مراجعه کنید، حداقل، یک مبنای مفید برای ارزیابی اهمیت مفاد DBE ارائه می‌دهد.

ب
قراردادها در این پرونده برای تعمیر پل بودند، نه استخدام اقلیت‌ها. دلایل متعددی وجود دارد که فکر کنیم مفاد DBE به "ماهیت معامله" نپرداخته است. خدمات بهداشت جهانی، 579 ایالات متحده، در 194، شماره 5.
اول، مفاد DBE به هدف اساسی قراردادها - تعمیر پل - بی‌ربط بودند، که نشان می‌دهد آنها از نوع شرایط «جزئی یا غیراساسی» بودند که نمی‌توان آنها را اساسی دانست. همان، صفحه ۱۹۴. همانطور که دادگاه حوزه سوم در زیر تشخیص داد، اگرچه درخواست‌کنندگان شرایط DBE اداره حمل و نقل پنسیلوانیا را برآورده نکردند، اما «کار درخواستی را تحویل دادند و کیفیت کار و مصالح [بدون هیچ گونه اعتراضی] بود.» 82 F. 4th 230, 244 (2023). 
اگر شرایط DBE «به اصل معامله [طرفین] مربوط می‌شد»، خدمات بهداشت جهانی، 579 ایالات متحده، در صفحه 194، شماره 5، عدم رعایت آن شرایط احتمالاً بر محصول نهایی کار تأثیر می‌گذاشت. توافق‌نامه، به عنوان مثال، کوهن، 257 N. Y.، در صفحه 400، 178 N. E.، در صفحه 674 (اصطلاحی را توصیف می‌کند که به «جوهر» یک توافق‌نامه مربوط می‌شود، به عنوان شرطی که اگر رعایت نشود، «ارزش [توافق‌نامه] را از بین می‌برد»)؛ 3511 13th St. Tenants’ Assn. v. 3511 13th St., N. W. Residences, LLC, 922 A. 2d 439, 445 (D. C. ۲۰۰۷) («برای اینکه نقضی اساسی تلقی شود، باید آنقدر جدی باشد که هدف اصلی توافق را از بین ببرد»). اما، شرایط DBE هیچ ارتباطی با توانایی شاکیان برای تکمیل پروژه‌هایشان نداشت. به ۸۲ F. 4th، صفحه ۲۴۴ مراجعه کنید. این عدم ارتباط تمایل دارد از این نتیجه‌گیری پشتیبانی کند که این الزامات، استاندارد «مهم» مادیت را که این دادگاه بیان کرده است، برآورده نمی‌کنند. خدمات بهداشت جهانی، ۵۷۹ U. S.، صفحه ۱۹۴؛ توافق، به عنوان مثال، Landmark Health Solutions, LLC در برابر شرکت بیمارستان غیرانتفاعی، ۹۵۰ F. Supp. 2d 130, 137–138 (DC 2013) («[رعایت] الزام منطقه برای ثبت نام و اخذ مجوز» به «هدف اساسی» قرارداد «ارائه خدمات مشاوره مدیریت و استخدام» منجر نشد). دوم، به نظر می‌رسد مفاد DBE نسبت به شرایط قرارداد که به کیفیت و به موقع بودن تعمیر پل، که بیشتر نشان می‌دهد مورد دوم به اصل معامله طرفین پرداخته در حالی که مورد اول نه. قراردادها PennDOT را ملزم می‌کردند که در صورت دیرکرد یا عدم رضایت از "کار... روی پروژه" از متقاضیان، پرداخت‌های معوقه را کسر کند. App. 109, 170. در حالی که قراردادها عدم رعایت مفاد DBE را "نقض اساسی" عنوان می‌کردند که "ممکن است منجر به فسخ قرارداد شود"، همان، در صفحات 114, 175 (تأکید اضافه شده است)، هیچ چیز در قراردادها PennDOT را ملزم به انجام اقدامی نمی‌کرد، چه رسد به اینکه پرداخت را متوقف یا کسر کند. Accord, Brief for United States 19 (عدم رعایت DBE "می‌توانست منجر به اقدام اصلاحی شود" (تأکید اضافه شده است)). 
همانطور که در خدمات بهداشت جهانی توضیح دادیم، در حالی که "تصمیم دولت برای شناسایی صریح یک شرط به عنوان شرط پرداخت" از اهمیت آن نمی‌کاهد، اما همچنان مرتبط است.هیچ مدرکی وجود ندارد که نشان دهد یک عبارت خاص مهم است. 579 U.S.، در صفحه 194. مرتبط کردن پرداخت با الزامات مربوط به کیفیت کار و به موقع بودن کار نشان می‌دهد که ماهیت قراردادهای طرفین، «کار... روی پروژه» - یعنی «نقاشی، تعمیرات سازه فولادی، تعمیرات سد انبساطی، روکش بتنی اصلاح‌شده با لاتکس و سایر ساخت‌وسازهای متفرقه» - به موقع و رضایت‌بخش بوده است، یا به طور کلی‌تر، «بهسازی پل‌ها»، App. 108-109, 169-170. قرارداد «با ارجاع به کل» را بخوانید، 11 Williston §32:5, p. 692 (ویرایش چهارم 2012)، فقدان نسبی چنین شرایط صریحی برای عدم رعایت DBE، مشاوران را از تفسیر آن مفاد در «هدف اساسی» قرارداد باز می‌دارد، 23 همان، §63:3، در صفحه 483.
سوم، ما توضیح داده‌ایم که تصمیم دولت برای انجام وظیفه خود در یک معامله «علیرغم آگاهی واقعی از نقض برخی الزامات»، «شواهد بسیار محکمی است که آن الزامات اساسی نیستند»، خدمات بهداشت جهانی، 579 ایالات متحده، در صفحه 195، و منطق مشابهی ممکن است در جایی که، مانند اینجا، نقض قراردادها بدنام و گسترده است، اعمال شود. هیچ کس ادعا نمی‌کند که دولت هنگام انعقاد قراردادها «آگاهی واقعی» از کلاهبرداری شاکیان داشته است. همان. اما، اگر کلاهبرداری DBE آنقدر شایع باشد که دولت مجبور شود فرض کند تعداد قابل توجهی از پیمانکاران آن مفاد قرارداد را که مستلزم رعایت DBE است، نقض می‌کنند، این واقعیت می‌تواند تردید بیشتری در مورد اهمیت آن مفاد ایجاد کند.
گزارش‌های مربوط به کلاهبرداری در برنامه‌های پیمانکاری کسب و کارهای کوچک دولت «با کمی نظم ظاهر شده است»، که کلاهبرداری در این برنامه‌ها را «به یک نگرانی همیشگی برای کنگره و مفسران تبدیل کرده است». خدمات تحقیقاتی کنگره، K. Manuel & E. Lunder، پیمانکاری و پیمانکاری فرعی فدرال با کسب و کارهای کوچک: مسائلی در کنگره 112، 33 (2012). برنامه DBE نیز از این قاعده مستثنی نیست: طرح‌های کلاهبرداری DBE که در آن از پیمانکاران اقلیت و زنان به عنوان «نمایندگان دروغین» استفاده می‌شود، «حوزه‌ای با مشکلات جدی در اجرا و انطباق است که به نظر می‌رسد در سطح ملی گسترده باشد». جلسه استماع نظارتی در مورد حذف اتلاف، کلاهبرداری و سوءاستفاده در برنامه‌های حمل و نقل اجباری در کمیته حمل و نقل و زیرساخت مجلس، کنگره 108، جلسه اول، 109 (2003) (جلسه استماع نظارتی). قانون‌گذاران مدت‌هاست که تشخیص داده‌اند کلاهبرداری DBE یک مشکل اساسی است و «مردم فقط به سیستم می‌خندند» و «به طور آشکار با سیستم بازی می‌کنند». همان، صفحات ۳۸-۳۹؛ همچنین به همان، صفحه ۳۶ مراجعه کنید (بازرس کل DOT شهادت می‌دهد که کلاهبرداری DBE «یک مشکل جدی است»).

با نگاهی به اهمیت «از دیدگاه سازنده [اظهارات گمراه‌کننده]»، اصلاحیه (دوم) قراردادها §۱۶۲، نظر c، صفحه ۴۴۱، آگاهی از اظهارات نادرست شایع در برنامه DBE می‌تواند به یک پیمانکار منطقی نشان دهد که، صرف نظر از زبان قرارداد، دولت در واقع انطباق با DBE را برای قراردادهای خود ضروری نمی‌داند. کلاهبرداری فراگیر همچنین نشان می‌دهد که دولت ممکن است با وجود دانستن اینکه طرف‌های مقابلش مرتباً الزامات DBE را نقض می‌کنند، به اجرای قراردادهای خود ادامه دهد و در ادامه علیه اهمیت این شرایط مشاوره دهد. به خدمات بهداشت جهانی، ۵۷۹ ایالات متحده، صفحات ۱۹۳-۱۹۴، شماره ... مراجعه کنید. 5، 195. 2
چهارم، اگر رعایت مفاد DBE قانون را نقض کند، دشوار است که ببینیم چگونه نشان دادن چنین رعایتی «احتمالاً یک فرد معقول را به ابراز رضایت خود ترغیب می‌کند.» بازگویی (دوم) قراردادها §162، نظر c، در صفحه 441. در میان چیزهای دیگر، برنامه DBE یک سیستم طبقه‌بندی صریحاً مبتنی بر نژاد را اعمال می‌کند، به بالا، در صفحات 2-3 مراجعه کنید، که «دقیق‌ترین بررسی قضایی» را ایجاب می‌کند، Adarand Constructors, Inc. v. Peña, 515 U. S. 200, 224 (1995). بنابراین، برای ادامه حیات این برنامه، دولت باید ثابت کند که به «تبعیض دولتی گذشته» که «مشخص و قابل ردیابی به سیستم جداسازی قانونی» است، رسیدگی می‌کند و اینکه سیستم جداسازی «اثر تبعیض‌آمیز گسسته و مداوم» دارد. پرونده Student for Fair Admissions, Inc. علیه رئیس و اعضای کالج هاروارد، 600 U. S. 181, 260 (2023) (با موافقت توماس، جی.). 
من شک دارم که دولت بتواند این استاندارد بالا را برآورده کند. در حالی که دولت در این پرونده مورد آزمایش قرار نگرفته است، به نظر می‌رسد در جای دیگری مزایای مبتنی بر نژاد برنامه DBE را بر این اساس تأیید کرده است که "اقلیت‌ها بیش از 20٪ از جمعیت را تشکیل می‌دهند" اما "فقط 9٪ از کل شرکت‌های ساختمانی را در اختیار دارند و فقط حدود 5٪ از درآمدهای ساختمانی را دریافت می‌کنند." جلسه استماع نظارت، در صفحه ۴۱. اما، «[اثبات] گزاره‌های گسترده جامعه‌شناختی با استفاده از آمار، کاری مشکوک است و ناگزیر با فلسفه هنجاری زیربنای بند حمایت برابر در تنش است.» لمپرشت علیه FCC، 958 F. 2d 382, ​​398 (CADC 1992) (THOMAS, Cir. J.، برای دادگاه) (به نقل از کریگ علیه بورن، 429 U. S. 190, 204 (1976)). و، حداقل یک دادگاه در ابتدا استفاده دولت از اهداف DBE را ممنوع کرده است زیرا دولت نمی‌تواند «[برنامه DBE] را توجیه کند»سیاست‌های تبعیض‌آمیز.» شرکت آسیاب مید-امریکن، 2024 WL 4267183، *11.
غیرقابل قبول است که فکر کنیم یک «فرد معقول» به مفاد قراردادی که نقض قانون اساسی را الزامی می‌کنند، «اهمیت» می‌دهد. خدمات بهداشت جهانی، 579 ایالات متحده، در 193، شماره 5. همین شهود در مورد بازیگران دولتی نیز صدق می‌کند. رجوع کنید به: سرویس پستی علیه گرگوری، 534 ایالات متحده 1، 10 (2001) («[یک] فرض قاعده‌مندی به اقدامات سازمان‌های دولتی مربوط می‌شود»). بنابراین، اگر دولت نتواند قانونی بودن برنامه DBE را اثبات کند، من شک دارم که بندی که مستلزم رعایت برنامه است، بتواند به اصل معامله طرفین منجر شود - به‌ویژه در اینجا، با توجه به اینکه همان مقرراتی که مستلزم رعایت DBE هستند، همزمان «تبعیض بر اساس نژاد، رنگ، ملیت یا جنسیت» را ممنوع می‌کنند. App. 114, 175.3
در اصل، استاندارد «ماهیت معامله» سختگیرانه و مختص به زمینه است. اگرچه در این مورد، قراردادها از زبانی استفاده کرده‌اند که نشان می‌دهد مفاد DBE اساسی هستند، به همانجا مراجعه کنید، ما روشن کرده‌ایم که تحقیق در مورد اهمیت به جای برچسب‌ها، به ماهیت می‌پردازد، به Universal Health Services, 579 U. S., at 190 مراجعه کنید. این تمرکز ممکن است پیگردهای قانونی دولت را در پرونده‌های DBE که در آنها اهمیت مورد اعتراض است، محکوم کند.

*  *  *
در ترغیب دادگاه به رد استدلال‌های زیان اقتصادی شاکیان امروز، دولت به ما اطمینان داده است که «استاندارد «ماهیت معامله» برای اهمیت» تضمین می‌کند که پیگردهای قانونی فدرال در مورد کلاهبرداری سیمی نمی‌توانند برای هدف قرار دادن تحریف‌های بی‌خطر و روزمره استفاده شوند. خلاصه برای ایالات متحده ۴۳. زیرا یک رویکرد سختگیرانه به اهمیت، تنها چیزی است که مانع از آن می‌شود که «دیدگاه فوق‌العاده گسترده از مسئولیت» قانون فدرال در مورد کلاهبرداری سیمی را تقریباً نامحدود کند. دامنه، خدمات بهداشت جهانی، 579 ایالات متحده، در صفحه 196، دادگاه‌های بدوی باید دولت را به حرف خود ملزم کنند.

_________________________________________
یادداشت‌ها
1 به نظر من، اکراه دادگاه برای فرض اهمیت هر ماده قرارداد به ویژه در زمینه قراردادهای دولتی مناسب است. دولت اغلب سعی می‌کند از مشوق‌های پولی برای پیشبرد اهداف سیاسی استفاده کند. به عنوان مثال، دولت گاهی اوقات به دنبال استفاده از قدرت هزینه خود برای "ایجاد انگیزه برای ایالت‌ها برای عمل مطابق با سیاست‌های فدرال" است. فدراسیون ملی کسب و کارهای مستقل علیه سبلیوس، 567 U. S. 519, 577 (2012) (نظر اکثریت). و این سیاست‌ها ممکن است ارتباط کمی با هزینه‌های بودجه فدرال داشته باشند. به عنوان مثال، به پرونده داکوتای جنوبی علیه دول، 483 U. S. 203, 218 (1987) (O’Connor, J., dissenting) مراجعه کنید (با این استدلال که "شرطی که یک ایالت سن مصرف مشروبات الکلی خود را به 21 سال افزایش دهد" از قدرت هزینه دولت فراتر رفته است زیرا نمی‌توان "به طور منصفانه گفت که به طور منطقی با هزینه‌های بودجه برای ساخت بزرگراه مرتبط است"). در قراردادهای دولتی، گنجاندن الزامات سیاسی یا نظارتی غیرمرتبط با هدف اصلی قراردادها توسط دولت، ممکن است به سادگی نشان دهنده تلاش دولت برای دستیابی به اهداف سیاستی با استفاده از موقعیت چانه‌زنی بی‌نظیر خود باشد. به نظر می‌رسد بی‌ربط بودن آشکار مفاد DBE به تعمیر پل با این الگو مطابقت دارد. به این صفحه و 7 در زیر مراجعه کنید.

2 قاضی سوتومایور اظهار می‌دارد که «[هیچ]بخشی از سوابق ذکر شده» نشان می‌دهد که PennDOT علیرغم آگاهی واقعی از نقض شرایط DBE، قراردادها را به طور کامل پرداخت کرده است. پست، در صفحه 7 (نظر موافق با قضاوت). من این را تشخیص داده‌ام، به بالا، در صفحه 8 مراجعه کنید، به همین دلیل پیشنهاد می‌کنم که تحلیل اهمیت من ممکن است در پیگردهای مختلف انطباق با DBE «که در آن اهمیت مورد بحث است»، در زیر، در صفحه 11، اعمال شود. به دلایل مشابه، نقد قاضی سوتومایور از «گزارش‌های دهه‌های قبل» بی‌ربط است. پست، در صفحه 7. گزارش‌ها و شهادت‌هایی که من ذکر می‌کنم، نمونه‌هایی را ارائه می‌دهند که نشان می‌دهد در سایر پیگردهای انطباق با DBE، متهمان ممکن است بتوانند سوابقی را ایجاد کنند که نشان دهد دولت به پیمانکاران پرداخت می‌کند، علیرغم اینکه می‌دانند که آنها با مفاد DBE مطابقت ندارند. قاضی سوتومایور این موضوع را رد نمی‌کند که در صورت ارائه، چنین سوابقی «شواهد محکمی مبنی بر عدم اهمیت الزامات [DBE]» را تشکیل می‌دهند. خدمات بهداشت جهانی، 579 ایالات متحده، در صفحه 195.
3 «[ادعای] مغایرت با قانون اساسی» «یک دوره داوطلبانه، عمدی و حساب‌شده از کلاهبرداری و فریب را توجیه نمی‌کند»، دنیس علیه ایالات متحده، 384 ایالات متحده 855، 867 (1966)، اما این سوال که آیا این مغایرت با قانون اساسی می‌تواند به اهمیت موضوع کمک کند یا خیر، متمایز است. هیچ کس انکار نمی‌کند که دادخواست‌دهندگان «مطابق بودن برنامه DBE با قانون اساسی را به چالش نکشیده‌اند». پست، ساعت ۸ (نظر سوتومایور، جی.). اما، اگر شاکیان این کار را می‌کردند، ممکن بود بتوانند به مغایرت مفاد DBE با قانون اساسی برای حمایت از استدلالی مبنی بر اینکه این مفاد برای قراردادهایشان «مهم» نیستند، استناد کنند.

قاضی گورساچ، که تا حدی موافق رأی است و در صدور حکم نیز موافق است. 
این پرونده به یک سؤال قدیمی می‌پردازد: تفاوت بین دروغ و کلاهبرداری چیست؟ یک فرضیه ساده را در نظر بگیرید. در یک مصاحبه تلفنی، یک زوج از یک پرستار بچه آینده می‌پرسند که آیا سابقه کیفری دارد یا خیر. پرستار بچه می‌گوید نه، اما این درست نیست. در حالی که او به دنبال تغییر زندگی خود بوده است، یک محکومیت سرقت در گذشته او کمین کرده است، محکومیتی که او از ذکر آن بسیار خجالت می‌کشد. با تکیه بر اظهارات نادرست او، والدین پرستار بچه را استخدام می‌کنند. کار او مثال‌زدنی است و زوج به او حقوق خوبی می‌دهند. اما بعداً، والدین متوجه دروغ پرستار بچه می‌شوند. آنها ممکن است ناراحت شوند و از استخدام مجدد او خودداری کنند. اما آیا پرستار بچه باید با اتهامات کلاهبرداری فدرال روبرو شود؟ البته که نه. در حالی که «فریب عمدی برای کسب سود گاهی اوقات باید مجازات شود»، اگر همه اظهارات نادرست به کلاهبرداری جنایی منجر شود، «هزاران خریدار و فروشنده» مجرم خواهند بود. تی. مکالی، جی. مک‌لئود، جی. اندرسون، و اف. میلت، یادداشت‌هایی در مورد قانون مجازات هند (1837)، در 7 زندگی و آثار لرد مکالی 527-528 (1897). 
دادگاه‌ها چگونه مرز بین دروغ‌های صرف و کلاهبرداری‌های جنایی را که توجه قانون را می‌طلبد، رعایت می‌کنند؟ یکی از ابزارهای مهم، الزام آسیب ناشی از کلاهبرداری است. برای اثبات کلاهبرداری جنایی، دادستان باید نشان دهد که قربانی آنچه را که متهم وعده داده بود، دریافت نکرده است. این قانونی است که افرادی مانند پرستار بچه ما را از دید دادستان محافظت می‌کند. و این قانونی است که مانع از تبدیل شدن قضات به داوران اخلاق خوب می‌شود. محکومیت کلاهبرداری می‌تواند به معنای سال‌ها، حتی دهه‌ها، زندان باشد. پیش از آنکه دادستانی بتواند چنین مجازاتی را درخواست کند و دادگاهی بتواند آن را مجاز کند، قانون چیزی بیش از دروغ بدون قربانی را مطالبه می‌کند.


در حالی که در بسیاری موارد دیگر درست است، تصمیم امروز دادگاه حاوی پاورقی است که به نظر می‌رسد قاعده تاریخی آسیب کلاهبرداری را رد می‌کند. دادگاه می‌گوید، طبق قانون فدرال کلاهبرداری الکترونیکی، فرقی نمی‌کند که قربانی فرضی تمام آنچه را که به او وعده داده شده است دریافت کند. به نظر می‌رسد دادگاه می‌گوید تا زمانی که او به دلیل ارائه نادرست متهم، پول یا اموالی را از دست بدهد، این آسیب برای محکومیت کلاهبرداری الکترونیکی فدرال کافی است. Ante، در 11، شماره 5. این یک پیشنهاد تکان‌دهنده است، پیشنهادی که هیچ پایه و اساسی در قانون عرفی کلاهبرداری یا قانون کلاهبرداری الکترونیکی ندارد و خطر تبدیل دروغ‌های بدون قربانی مانند دروغ‌های پرستار بچه ما به جرایم فدرال را به همراه دارد. با احترام، این نمی‌تواند قانون باشد.


سوالی که در این پرونده مطرح شده، سوال محدودی است. طرفین از ما می‌خواهند که حل کنیم آیا قانون فدرال کلاهبرداری سیمی، 18 U. S. C. §1343، دولت را ملزم به اثبات این می‌کند که خوانده به قربانی خود «ضرر مالی خالص» وارد کرده است یا خیر. خلاصه برای ایالات متحده (I) (با ذکر سوال مطرح شده)؛ قبل از رسیدگی، در صفحات 1-2. امروز، دادگاه معتقد است که پاسخ منفی است. دادگاه توضیح می‌دهد که کنگره، قانون فدرال کلاهبرداری سیمی را بر خلاف قوانین عرفی تصویب کرد. قبل از رسیدگی، در صفحه 8. و در قانون عرفی، کلاهبرداری مستلزم اثبات آسیب دیدن قربانی بود. قبل از رسیدگی، در صفحه 11.1. اما این الزام آسیب هرگز مستلزم اثبات این نبود که قربانی متحمل «ضرر مالی خالص» شده است. بنابراین، دادگاه نتیجه می‌گیرد که قانون فدرال کلاهبرداری سیمی نیز چنین نیست. در مورد هر یک از این نکات، دادگاه و من موافقیم. 
اما با توجه به بررسی سوال مطرح شده، دادگاه در اینجا متوقف نمی‌شود. در عوض، دادگاه در ادامه ادعا می‌کند که الزام آسیب در قانون کلاهبرداری الکترونیکی زمانی برآورده می‌شود که متهم «اموالی را به دست آورد» که قربانی «در غیر این صورت از طریق ارائه اطلاعات نادرست از آن صرف نظر نمی‌کرد». Ante، در صفحه 11، شماره 5. تفسیر دادگاه در مورد این موضوع ممکن است به راحتی نادیده گرفته شود. این فقط در یک پاورقی کوتاه در اعماق نظر دادگاه آمده است. و در نگاه اول، اظهارات دادگاه ممکن است به اندازه کافی بی‌ضرر به نظر برسد. از این گذشته، ممکن است کسی تعجب کند که اگر کلاهبرداری باعث شود قربانی پول یا اموال خود را از دست بدهد، آیا این لزوماً یک آسیب نیست؟ 
با این حال، من نگران هستم که ظواهر اولیه ممکن است فریب دهنده باشند و پاورقی سرگردان دادگاه می‌تواند نشان‌دهنده مشکل باشد. با این مشکل شروع کنید: آنچه دادگاه در پاورقی خود می‌گوید با استدلال بالای خط آن مطابقت ندارد. در ادامه‌ی نظر خود، دادگاه اذعان می‌کند که ارجاعات قانون کلاهبرداری الکترونیکی به «طرح یا حیله برای کلاهبرداری» و «تظاهرات دروغین یا متقلبانه»، ماده‌ی ۱۳۴۳ (تأکید اضافه شده)، «خاک قدیمی» کلاهبرداری در حقوق عرفی، ماده‌ی ۸، را با خود به همراه دارد. در نتیجه، دکترین‌های حقوق عرفی حاکم بر جرم تظاهر دروغین، جرم فریب و راهکار فسخ قرارداد، همگی تا حدودی معنای قانون کلاهبرداری الکترونیکی را بیان می‌کنند. ماده‌ی ۹-۱۳. با این حال، برخلاف آنچه دادگاه در پاورقی خود پیشنهاد می‌کند، در حقوق عرفی «صرف به دست آوردن پول [یا مال] با تظاهر دروغین به تنهایی» الزام آسیب کلاهبرداری را برآورده نمی‌کند. State v. Palmer, 50 Kan. 318, 324, 32 P. 29, 30 (1893); توافق، ایالت علیه کاسپرسون، ۷۱ یوتا ۶۸، ۷۵، ۲۶۲ صفحه ۲۹۴، ۲۹6 (1927). در عوض، دادگاه‌های کامن‌لا معمولاً مدرکی را مطالبه می‌کردند که نشان دهد متهم قربانی خود را از «آنچه که برایش چانه‌زنی کرده» محروم کرده است. State v. Asher, 50 Ark. 427, 430–431, 8 S. W. 177, 178 (1888). زمانی که کنگره در سال 1952 قانون کلاهبرداری الکترونیکی را تصویب کرد، به نظر می‌رسد که «هر حوزه قضایی آمریکایی به جز تگزاس» قانون مشابهی را اتخاذ کرده بود. Comment, Injury as a Element of Criminal Fraud, 23 U. Chi. L. Rev. 509, 511, and n. 7 (1956) (Injury as a Element). 
همچنین تفاوت بین فرمول دادگاه از الزام آسیب کلاهبرداری و قاعده کامن‌لا ناچیز نیست. مطمئناً، به دست آوردن پول یا اموال از طریق ارائه اطلاعات نادرست مادی معمولاً به قربانی آسیب می‌رساند. اما نه همیشه. برای درک چرایی آن، چند مثال مفید است. با برخی از موارد از حقوق عرفی شروع کنید. در پرونده رکس علیه ویلیامز، 7 Car. & P. ​​354, 173 Eng. Rep. 158 (N. P. 1836) (Coleridge, J.)، طلبکاری که به دنبال تسویه بدهی بود، به خدمتکار خود دستور داد تا با ادعای دروغین مبنی بر اینکه «اربابش [آنها] را خریده است»، بدهکار را به تحویل «دو کیسه مالت» ترغیب کند. همان. اگرچه خدمتکار «آگاهانه آنچه را که نادرست بود بیان کرد» و اظهارات نادرست او به وضوح اساسی بود، اما اعمال او مجرمانه نبود زیرا او صرفاً قصد تسویه بدهی را داشت، نه «کلاهبرداری» از بدهکار. همان، در 355، 173 Eng. Rep. در 158. دادگاهی در نیویورک بعداً هنگام مواجهه با حقایق مشابه اظهار داشت که «دشوار است» که چگونه یک قربانی «آسیب می‌بیند» وقتی که صرفاً «فریب» می‌خورد تا آنچه را که بدهکار است بپردازد. پرونده‌های People v. Thomas، 3 Hill 169, 170 (N. Y. Sup. Ct. 1842)؛ accord، پرونده‌های People v. Baker، 96 N. Y. 340, 347–348 (1884)؛ پرونده‌های People v. Wakely، 62 Mich. 297, 300–303, 28 N. W. 871, 872–873 (1886).


مثال‌های معاصر تحت قانون فدرال کلاهبرداری تلفنی نیز این نکته را نشان می‌دهند. تصور کنید یک شرکت ارسال انبوه قول می‌دهد که از یک سرویس «با نرخ بالا» برای تحویل محصولات مشتریان خود استفاده کند، اما در واقع این شرکت با استفاده از یک سرویس ارزان‌تر، تحویل‌ها را «به موقع به مقصد مناسب» انجام می‌دهد. پرونده United States v. Starr، 816 F. 2d 94, 99–100 (CA2 1987). بدون شک، اظهارات نادرست شرکت باعث می‌شود مشتریانش پول خود را از دست بدهند. با این حال، همانطور که دادگاه حوزه دوم تشخیص داده است، دروغ‌های شرکت ضرری ایجاد نمی‌کند زیرا هیچ «اختلافی بین مزایای «منطقی پیش‌بینی‌شده» و مزایای واقعی دریافتی وجود ندارد.» همان، صفحه 99؛ آکورد، ایالات متحده علیه شرکت تامین اداری ریجنت، 421 F. 2d 1174، 1179–1180 (1970). یا فرض کنید متقاضی در رزومه خود در مورد برآورده کردن شرایط استخدام دروغ می‌گوید. او شغل را به دست می‌آورد و کار را دقیقاً طبق وعده انجام می‌دهد. دروغ کارمند، شرکت را وادار به از دست دادن پول (دستمزد او) می‌کند. اما، همانطور که دادگاه حوزه دوم حکم داده است، دروغ‌های کارمند به کارفرما ضرری نمی‌رساند، زیرا «دروغ‌های او کارفرما را از مزایای معامله‌اش محروم نمی‌کند.» ایالات متحده علیه گرتین، 67 F. 4th 445, 451 (2023)؛ آکورد، ایالات متحده علیه تاخالوف، 827 F. 3d 1307, 1313–1319 (CA11 2016)؛ ایالات متحده علیه شلف، 507 F. 3d 82, 108 (CA2 2007).2
همانطور که همه این مثال‌ها نشان می‌دهند، قاعده سنتیِ «ضرر ناشی از معامله» یک جزءِ بی‌اهمیت نیست. این قاعده نقش مهمی در تفکیک دروغ‌های صرف از کلاهبرداری‌های جنایی و به این ترتیب، کاهش خطر پیگردهای قانونیِ بی‌اساس دارد. فقط از خود بپرسید، اگر «قربانیِ فرضیِ کلاهبرداریِ بانکی دقیقاً همان چیزی را که بابتش پول داده، دریافت کند، اصلاً چگونه قربانی محسوب می‌شود؟» ایالات متحده علیه پورات، 76 F. 4th 213, 227 (CA3 2023) (کراس، جی.، موافق). و اصلاً به دولت چه مربوط است که دروغ‌های بدون قربانی را با زندان مجازات کند؟
بنابراین، تفسیر پاورقی دادگاه چیز کوچکی نیست. با نادیده گرفتن قانون سنتی حقوق عرفی، این خطر وجود دارد که دادستان‌ها و دادگاه‌ها به پلیس اخلاق با مأموریت پیگرد قانونی و مجازات دروغ‌های بی‌ضرر تبدیل شوند. در واقع، تحت رویکرد جدید دادگاه، دشوار است که ببینیم چه چیزی پرستار بچه ما را از محکومیت کلاهبرداری سیمی فدرال نجات می‌دهد. فقط در نظر بگیرید: او عمداً دروغ گفته است. او این کار را با استفاده از سیم‌ها انجام داده است. دروغ او مهم است زیرا برای والدین منطقی مهم است که کسی که در خانه آنها با فرزندانشان کار می‌کند، محکومیت سرقت جنایی داشته باشد. والدین به طور منطقی به اصرار پرستار بچه مبنی بر پاک بودن سابقه او اعتماد کردند. و آنها به دلیل دروغ او از پول خود گذشتند. به نظر دادگاه، به نظر می‌رسد همه عناصر جرم برآورده شده است و اظهارات نادرست زودگذر پرستار بچه ممکن است برای او تا 20 سال زندان هزینه داشته باشد. تنها راه برای اطمینان از اینکه پرونده‌هایی مانند پرونده پرستار بچه ما به حوزه دادستان‌ها و دادگاه‌های فدرال تبدیل نشود، تشخیص چیزی است که حقوق عرفی مدت‌هاست به رسمیت شناخته است: دروغ‌های بدون آسیب، کلاهبرداری جنایی نیستند. II
پانویس دیوان به هیچ یک از این مشکلات نمی‌پردازد. در عوض، دیوان برای تأیید پیشنهاد خود مبنی بر اینکه از دست دادن پول یا اموال همیشه برای احراز خسارت کافی است، در درجه اول به تصمیم دیوان عالی پنسیلوانیا استناد می‌کند. Ante، در صفحات 11-12، شماره 5 (با استناد به Williams v. Kerr، 152 Pa. 560, 565, 25 A. 618, 619 (1893)). اما حتی آن پرونده هم پابرجا نیست.برای چیزی شبیه به قاعده‌ای که دادگاه تصور می‌کند. 
در حقیقت، ویلیامز هیچ فرصتی برای انحراف از قاعده سنتی آسیب نداشت. در آنجا، متهم با ارائه نادرست برنامه‌های خود برای بهبود قطعه زمین، قربانیان خود را به فروش نیمی از زمین‌هایشان ترغیب کرد - برنامه‌هایی که (در صورت صحت) "ارزش" سهم باقی‌مانده قربانیان را "به میزان زیادی افزایش می‌دادند". همان، صفحه ۵۶۴، ۲۵ الف، صفحه ۶۱۹. از آنجا که بهبودهای برنامه‌ریزی‌شده خیالی از آب درآمد، متهم نتوانست آنچه فروشندگان برای آن چانه‌زنی کرده بودند را ارائه دهد. نکته قابل توجه دیگر این است که بیان ویلیامز از قاعده آسیب با آزمون سنتی سازگار است. دادگاه نگفت که به دست آوردن پول یا اموال از طریق ارائه نادرست مادی همیشه کافی است. در عوض، دادگاه اظهار داشت که به دست آوردن پول یا اموال با "شرایطی" که قربانی در غیر این صورت "نمی‌پذیرفت" یک آسیب خواهد بود. همان. (تأکید اضافه شده است). و دروغ گفتن برای به دست آوردن شرایط مطلوب‌تر اغلب مستلزم محروم کردن قربانی از "آنچه وانمود شده و آنچه برای آن چانه‌زنی کرده بود" است. کاسپرسون، ۷۱ یوتا، در صفحات ۷۵، ۲۶۲ پی.، در صفحات ۲۹۶.

مراجع حقوقی باقی‌مانده دادگاه دیگر برای هدف آن مفید نیستند. نه مک‌لارن علیه کوکران، ۴۴ مین. ۲۵۵، ۲۵۸، ۴۶ شمال غربی. ۴۰۸، ۴۰۹ (۱۸۹۰)، و نه کارلایل علیه ایالت، ۷۶ آلاباما. ۷۵، ۷۷ (۱۸۸۴)، به الزام آسیب مالی یا مالی که دادگاه اتخاذ می‌کند، اشاره‌ای نمی‌کنند. در همین حال، رساله دادگاه با استناد به پرونده‌ای که قاعده سنتی مبنی بر اینکه کسانی که «تمام ... مورد انتظار خود را به دست می‌آورند» «فریب خورده یا فریب خورده نیستند» را تأیید می‌کند، از بحث در مورد عنصر آسیب کلاهبرداری پشتیبانی می‌کند. State v. Matthews, 44 Kan. 596, 606, 25 P. 36, 40 (1890) (به نقل از 1 E. McClain, Criminal Law §680, p. 686 (1897)).3
نه تنها مراجع حقوق عرفی دادگاه از دیدگاه خود در مورد ماهیت الزام آسیب ناشی از کلاهبرداری حمایت نمی‌کنند، بلکه هیچ چیز در متن قانون کلاهبرداری الکترونیکی نیز چنین نیست. این قانون استفاده از تراکنش‌های الکترونیکی را برای انجام «هرگونه طرح یا ترفندی برای کلاهبرداری... برای به دست آوردن پول یا اموال» ممنوع می‌کند. 18 U. S. C. §1343. همانطور که این دادگاه تشخیص داده است، این عبارت به این معنی است که دادستان باید ثابت کند (1) متهم «در یک «طرح یا حیله برای کلاهبرداری» مشارکت داشته است» و (2) «موضوع کلاهبرداری «پول یا اموال» در دست قربانی بوده است». پاسکوانتینو علیه ایالات متحده، 544 U. S. 349, 355 (2005) (به نقل از کلیولند علیه ایالات متحده، 531 U. S. 12, 26 (2000) (تغییر حذف شده است)). بنابراین حتی زمانی که دادستان بتواند نشان دهد که متهم به دنبال به دست آوردن پول یا اموال بوده است، باید همچنان اثبات کند که متهم قصد «طرح یا حیله برای کلاهبرداری» را داشته است - عبارتی که همه موافقند عناصر سنتی کلاهبرداری در حقوق عرفی را وارد می‌کند. به مقدمه، در 8، 11 مراجعه کنید. و همانطور که دیده‌ایم، این عناصر شامل الزام آسیب است که وقتی یک قربانی فرضی از معامله خود سود می‌برد، برآورده نمی‌شود. دادگاه که بدون مرجع حقوق عرفی یا متن قانونی برای حمایت از دیدگاه خود باقی مانده است، به نظر می‌رسد که کنار گذاشتن قاعده سنتی آسیب حداقل می‌تواند سیاست خوبی باشد. اگرچه دادگاه‌های حقوق عرفی مدت‌هاست که این سوال را مطرح می‌کنند که آیا خوانده «چیزی متفاوت از آنچه وعده داده شده بود، ارائه داده است» یا خیر، اما به نظر می‌رسد این استدلال ادامه دارد، اما این آزمون ممکن است برای قضات امروزی بسیار دشوار باشد. آنته، در ساعت ۱۴. در عوض، به ما گفته می‌شود که عنصر «مادی بودن» کلاهبرداری، راهی «اصولی‌تر» و به همان اندازه رضایت‌بخش‌تر برای تمایز دروغ محض از کلاهبرداری کیفری ارائه می‌دهد. آنته، در ساعت ۱۵.
اما این به هیچ وجه پاسخ نیست. ترجیح قضایی برای قوانین «اصولی» نمی‌تواند جایگزین آنچه که قانون است و مدت‌هاست بوده است، شود. وقتی برای راهنمایی به خاک قدیمی حقوق عرفی نگاه می‌کنیم، هیچ مجوزی برای شخم زدن آنچه در آنجا می‌یابیم، نداریم. همچنین این نظر دادگاه درست نیست که عنصر مادی بودن کلاهبرداری می‌تواند تمام کارهایی را که به طور سنتی توسط الزام آسیب آن انجام می‌شود، به دوش بکشد. همانطور که این دادگاه توصیف می‌کند، عنصر مادی بودن کلاهبرداری معمولاً می‌پرسد که «آیا یک فرد معقول در تصمیم‌گیری در مورد نحوه‌ی اقدام، به [دروغ متهم] اهمیت می‌دهد؟» همان. (با استناد به Universal Health Services, Inc. v. United States ex rel. Escobar, 579 U. S. 176, 193 (2016)). و همانطور که مثال‌های بالا نشان می‌دهند، دنیای سقوط کرده‌ی ما پر از دروغ‌هایی است، حتی دروغ‌های مادی، که توجه مقامات کیفری را جلب نمی‌کنند: طلبکارانی که برای دریافت بدهی‌های خود از بدهکاران فراری دروغ می‌گویند، کارمندانی که برای به دست آوردن شغل در مورد اعتبارنامه‌های خود دروغ می‌گویند، و حتی پرستاران بچه‌ای که گذشته‌ی خود را نادرست جلوه می‌دهند. در تمام این موارد، یک فرد معقول در تصمیم‌گیری در مورد اینکه آیا و چگونه باید اقدام کرد، به دروغ متهم اهمیت می‌دهد. در تمام این موارد نیز، دروغ عمدی است، باعث ایجاد اعتماد معقول می‌شود و باعث می‌شود کسی پول یا اموال خود را از دست بدهد. بدون الزام سنتی آسیب، هر یک از این پرونده‌ها به دام دادستان می‌افتند.


حتی اگر به خودی خود در نظر گرفته شود، استدلال دادگاه گمراه‌کننده است. عنصر اهمیت حقوق عرفی «اصولی‌تر» از قاعده سنتی آسیب نیست. قبل از آن، در ساعت ۱۵. بله، قاعده سنتی آسیب ممکن است دادگاه‌ها را ملزم به ارزیابی این موضوع کند که آیا خوانده به آنچه وعده داده بود عمل کرده است یا خیر، وپاسخ به این سوال همیشه ساده نخواهد بود. به همانجا مراجعه کنید. اما همین امر در مورد عنصر مادی بودن نیز صادق است، جایی که دادگاه‌ها باید تصمیم بگیرند که آیا خوانده یک اصطلاح «جزئی» (غیرمادی) یا یک اصطلاح «اساسی» (مادی) را به اشتباه ارائه داده است. Universal Health Services, Inc., 579 U. S., at 193–194, and n. 5.

یک مثال برجسته در نظر دادگاه را در نظر بگیرید. فرض کنید خوانده قول می‌دهد «اسبی به نام چارلی» را تحویل دهد. Ante, at 15 (به نقل از State v. Mills, 17 Me. 211, 212 (1840)). این اظهارات در صورتی مادی خواهد بود که معاملات طرفین نشان دهد که یک فرد معقول در جایگاه خریدار به هویت خاص اسب اهمیت می‌دهد. اما اگر این معاملات نشان دهد که در شرایط یک صنعت یا معامله خاص، خریدار فقط به اسبی از نوع و کیفیت خاص علاقه‌مند بوده است، اظهارات مادی نخواهد بود. وقتی صحبت از عنصر مادی کلاهبرداری می‌شود، به همان اندازه که در مورد عنصر آسیب کلاهبرداری مطرح می‌شود، جزئیات می‌توانند مهم باشند، گاهی اوقات باید مرزهای دشواری ترسیم شوند و در ترسیم آنها، دادگاه‌ها ممکن است مجبور باشند با دقت به شرایط پیرامون معامله طرفین توجه کنند.4

اگر خبر خوبی در مورد پاورقی دادگاه وجود داشته باشد، می‌تواند این باشد: این انحراف، حکمی است که به سؤالی بسیار "فراتر از پرونده" می‌پردازد. Cohens v. Virginia, 6 Wheat. 264, 399–400 (1821). دقیقاً هیچ چیز امروز پیش روی ما نیست که آیا الزام آسیب کلاهبرداری الکترونیکی مستلزم اثبات این است که قربانی سود معامله خود را دریافت نکرده است یا در عوض، فقط اثبات این است که او پول یا اموال را واگذار کرده است. همچنین اتخاذ یک قانون به جای قانون دیگر، گامی ضروری به سوی این نظر دادگاه نیست که "ضرر مالی" "عنصر کلاهبرداری" نیست. Ante, at 12, n. 5.
فقط از خود بپرسید: اگر دادگاه پاورقی خود را حذف می‌کرد، یا موضع خود را معکوس می‌کرد و قاعده سنتی آسیب را تأیید می‌کرد، آیا نتیجه‌گیری آن در مورد ضرر اقتصادی متفاوت بود؟ البته که نه. تحت هر دو دیدگاه، آقای کوسیس بازنده است. او بازنده است زیرا دروغ‌های او باعث شد وزارت حمل و نقل پنسیلوانیا هنگام پرداخت هزینه‌های پروژه‌های ساختمانی مورد بحث، پول را واگذار کند. و او بازنده است زیرا این وزارتخانه آنچه را که در ازای آن چانه‌زنی کرده بود، دریافت نکرد: پروژه‌هایی که با استفاده از شرکت‌های «از نظر اجتماعی و اقتصادی محروم» تکمیل شدند. Ante، در 2؛ همچنین به ante، در 4 مراجعه کنید. از آنجا که آقای کوسیس هم تحت قاعده سنتی آسیب و هم تحت قاعده جدید دادگاه مرتکب کلاهبرداری شده است، «پاورقی[e] یکبار مصرف» دادگاه هیچ تفاوتی ایجاد نمی‌کند. Royal Canin U. S. A., Inc. v. Wullschleger, 604 U. S. 22, 42–43 (2025).
هر چقدر هم که تلاش شود، دادگاه نمی‌تواند «با تکان دادن چوبدستی و گفتن کلمه «دست نگه دارید» حکم را به تصمیم تبدیل کند.» ایالات متحده علیه روبین، 609 F. 2d 51, 69, n. 2 (CA2 1979) (فرندلی، جی.، موافق). و هیچ چیز در تصمیم امروز نمی‌تواند این دادگاه را در پرونده‌ای در آینده که تفاوت بین دو قانون واقعاً مهم است، ملزم کند. رجوع کنید به Seminole Tribe of Fla. v. Florida, 517 U. S. 44, 66 (1996); Loper Bright Enterprises v. Raimondo, 603 U. S. 369, 426 (2024) (گورساچ، جی.، موافق). *

طی قرن‌ها تجربه، دادگاه‌های حقوق عرفی ابزارهای متنوعی را برای تشخیص دروغ‌های قابل قبول از کلاهبرداری‌های جنایی توسعه داده‌اند. در یک انحراف کوتاه و تاسف‌بار در یک نظرِ در غیر این صورت درست، دادگاه در مورد اینکه آیا یکی از آن ابزارها هنوز تحت قانون فدرال کلاهبرداری سیمی اعمال می‌شود یا خیر، تردید ایجاد می‌کند. در این فرآیند، دادگاه بی‌جهت قانون فدرال کلاهبرداری سیمی را به سلاحی برای مجازات جرایم بدون قربانی تبدیل می‌کند. من فقط می‌توانم اعتماد کنم که دادگاه‌های آینده این را صرف نظر از آنچه هست - حکم نادرست - تشخیص خواهند داد.

1 پرونده‌ها و رساله‌های بی‌شماری از نتیجه‌گیری دادگاه مبنی بر اینکه هر یک از آن دکترین‌های حقوق عرفی، الزام آسیب را داشته‌اند، پشتیبانی می‌کنند. برای جرم ادعاهای دروغین، به State v. Palmer, 50 Kan. 318, 323–324, 32 P. 29, 30 (1893) مراجعه کنید؛ State v. Matthews, 44 Kan. 596, 602–603, 25 P. 36, 38 (1890) مراجعه کنید؛ ایالات متحده علیه راش، 196 F. 579 (ED Wash. 1912)؛ 2 Bishop on Criminal Law §§415–417 (ویرایش‌های J. Zane & C. Zollman، ویرایش نهم، 1923)؛ 2 H. Brill، Cyclopedia of Criminal Law §1271 (1923). برای راهکار فسخ قراردادی، به Williams v. Kerr، 152 Pa. 560, 565, 25 A. 618, 619 (1893)؛ Spreckels v. Gorrill، 152 Cal. 383, 388, 92 P. 1011, 1015 (1907)؛ 1 H. Black, Rescission of Contracts and Cancellation of Written Instruments §37، صفحه 90 (1916)؛ 2 T. Parsons, Law of Contracts *268–*269 (ویرایش چهارم 1860). و برای جرم فریب، به Dura Pharmaceuticals, Inc. v. Broudo, 544 U. S. 336, 343–344 (2005) مراجعه کنید.

2 البته، قانون فدرال کلاهبرداری الکترونیکی، «طرح کلاهبرداری» را به جای «کلاهبرداری کامل» ممنوع می‌کند، بنابراین متهم نیازی به دنبال کردن نقشه خود برای ارتکاب جرم ندارد. Neder v. United States, 527 U. S. 1, 25 (1999). اما، همانطور که در موارد فوق مشخص است، عنصر آسیب همچنان اهمیت دارد. همانطور که پس از یک جرم تلاش برای ارتکاب جرم در حقوق عرفی مدل‌سازی شده است، قانون کلاهبرداری الکترونیکی مستلزم اثبات «قصد خاص برای ارتکاب عمل غیرقانونی» است. Braxton v. United States, 500 U.S. 344, 351, n. (1991); رجوع کنید به United States v. Coffman, 94 F. 3d 330, 333 (CA7 1996) (کلاهبرداری الکترونیکی «تلاش برای کلاهبرداری را مجازات می‌کند»). بنابراین دولت باید ثابت کند که طرح مورد نظر متهم، در صورت تکمیل، قربانی را از مزایای معامله طرفین محروم می‌کرد، زیرا «تلاش برای انجام کاری که قانون جزا شما را از انجام آن منع نمی‌کند، تلاش مجرمانه محسوب نمی‌شود.» همان، صفحه 333. همین امر در مورد سایر عناصر کلاهبرداری سنتی، مانند اتکای معقول و علیت نیز صدق می‌کند. اگرچه دولت برای صدور حکم محکومیت کلاهبرداری الکترونیکی نیازی به اثبات اتکای واقعی یا علیت ندارد، Neder, 527 U. S., صفحه 25، اما باید ثابت کند که متهم این نتایج را در نظر داشته است، رجوع کنید به ALI, Model Penal Code §5.01, Comment 2, p. 303 (1985) (تلاش مستلزم آن است که "متهم هدفی را آشکار کند... تا نوعی نتیجه را که توسط قانون جزا ممنوع است، ایجاد کند").

3 بدون مرجع کامن لا برای حمایت از دیدگاه خود، دادگاه به بی‌اعتبار کردن مرجع مخالف متوسل می‌شود، به این دلیل که برخی از پرونده‌های کامن لا، قاعده نفع معامله را به عنوان محصول قصد تقلب یا عناصر دروغین آن، و نه عنصر ضرر آن، مورد بحث قرار می‌دهند. به مقدمه، در 13، شماره 6 مراجعه کنید. اما این چه چیزی را ثابت می‌کند؟ فقط اینکه دادگاه‌های کامن لا برای اجرای قاعده نفع معامله به عناصر مختلفی تکیه کرده‌اند - نه اینکه دادگاه‌ها این الزام را رد کرده‌اند. همچنین جای تعجب نیست که برخی از دادگاه‌ها ضرر را در ارتباط با "قصد کلاهبرداری" متهم در نظر گرفته‌اند. همان. از این گذشته، کلاهبرداری را می‌توان به عنوان یک جرم ناتمام تحت پیگرد قانونی قرار داد. بنابراین دولت می‌تواند با نشان دادن اینکه متهم قصد داشته تمام عناصر جرم تکمیل شده، از جمله ضرر و قاعده نفع معامله آن را ایجاد کند، محکومیت را تضمین کند. Supra، در 5، شماره 2؛ آسیب به عنوان یک عنصر 511، و شماره 7.
4 همچنین، برخلاف پیشنهاد دادگاه، اهمیت گزینه بهتری نیست زیرا یک استاندارد "عینی" ارائه می‌دهد. Ante، در 15، شماره 7. آزمون سنتی برای آسیب نیز یک تحقیق عینی است که می‌پرسد آیا "اختلافی بین مزایای معقول پیش‌بینی شده" بر اساس تمام معاملات طرفین و "مزایای واقعی که خوانده ارائه داده یا قصد ارائه آن را داشته است" وجود دارد یا خیر. United States v. Starr, 816 F. 2d 94, 98 (CA2 1987) (به نقل از United States v. Regent Office Supply Co., 421 F. 2d 1174, 1182 (CA2 1970)؛ تأکید اضافه شده است). جالب اینجاست که پیشنهاد دادگاه برای کنار گذاشتن قاعده سنتی آسیب کلاهبرداری و تکیه بر الزام مادی بودن کلاهبرداری، درست نقطه مقابل پیشنهادی است که توسط تدوین‌کنندگان قانون مجازات نمونه ارائه شده است. آنها پیشنهاد کردند که الزام مادی بودن قانون عرفی به طور کلی کنار گذاشته شود، حتی در حالی که به قاعده سنتی آسیب پایبند بودند که دادن «دقیقاً همان چیزی که متهم برای آن چانه‌زنی کرده است» به او کلاهبرداری کیفری محسوب نمی‌شود. ALI، قانون مجازات نمونه §223.3، نظر †، صفحات 180-181، 194 (1980). پاورقی دادگاه به این موضوع نمی‌پردازد که چرا باید دقیقاً برعکس عمل کنیم. _________________________________________

قاضی سوتومایور، موافق حکم. 
دادگاه امروز به درستی درخواست خواهان‌ها برای الحاق الزام ضرر اقتصادی به قانون کلاهبرداری الکترونیکی فدرال را رد می‌کند. وقتی متهم با وعده یک چیز و تحویل چیزی اساساً متفاوت، قربانی را فریب می‌دهد و پولش را از او می‌گیرد، گفتن اینکه اقلام تحویل داده شده ارزش اقتصادی یکسانی دارند، دفاعیه محسوب نمی‌شود. همانطور که اکثریت توضیح می‌دهند، متن قانون، رویه قضایی و تاریخ این نتیجه‌گیری را ایجاب می‌کند. به بخش قبل، در صفحات 7 تا 16 مراجعه کنید. عقل سلیم، همانطور که انتظار می‌رود، در همین راستا اشاره می‌کند. یک هوادار یانکیز که فریب خرید بلیط‌های متس را خورده است، به همان اندازه که بلیط‌های وعده داده شده یانکیز ارزش دارند، فریب خورده است. این نتیجه‌گیری سرراست، تمام چیزی است که برای حل این پرونده لازم است و من بیشتر از این ادامه نمی‌دهم. تا جایی که به نظر می‌رسد اکثریت به طور کلی‌تر صحبت می‌کنند، من از رویکرد آنها فاصله می‌گیرم.


همانطور که اکثریت توضیح می‌دهند، این پرونده به الزام مالکیت قانون کلاهبرداری سیمی می‌پردازد که دامنه قانون را به طرح‌هایی «برای کلاهبرداری یا برای به دست آوردن پول یا اموال» محدود می‌کند. 18 U. S. C. §1343. اگرچه این عبارت از «زبان گسسته» استفاده می‌کند، دادگاه آن را به عنوان «یک کل واحد» تفسیر کرده است. کلی علیه ایالات متحده، 590 U. S. 391, 398 (2020) (با استناد به §1343). زیرا «فهم رایج» از کلمات «کلاهبرداری» در زمان تصویب قانون، به «تجاوز به حقوق مالکیت» اشاره داشت. «Ciminelli v. United States, 598 U. S. 306, 312 (2023) (به نقل از Cleveland v. United States, 531 U. S. 12, 19 (2000)). بر این اساس، حتی قبل از اینکه کنگره قانون را اصلاح کند تا عبارت «یا برای به دست آوردن پول یا اموال» را اضافه کند، قانون «فقط طرح‌هایی را که مردم را از منافع مالکیت سنتی محروم می‌کند» جرم‌انگاری می‌کرد.س.» Ciminelli، 598 U. S.، صفحه 309؛ همچنین به Cleveland، 531 U. S.، صفحه 18-19 مراجعه کنید (بازگویی تاریخچه اصلاحیه ماده 1343). 
در اینجا، شاکیان، وزارت حمل و نقل پنسیلوانیا (PennDOT) را متقاعد کردند که با دروغ گفتن در مورد ماهیت آنچه می‌فروشند، ده‌ها میلیون دلار به آنها بدهد. شاکیان قول دادند که خدمات تعمیراتی را که مطابق با برنامه کسب و کار محروم (DBE) وزارت حمل و نقل ایالات متحده است، به PennDOT ارائه دهند. به 49 CFR §26.21 (2024) مراجعه کنید. آنها به PennDOT اظهار داشتند که یک کسب و کار واجد شرایط محروم، خدمات نقاشی را برای پروژه‌های مرمت، همانطور که توسط کمک هزینه فدرال PennDOT الزامی است، ارائه می‌دهد و آنها صریحاً این الزام را به عنوان یک اصطلاح "مادی" در قراردادهای خود ذکر کردند. Ante، صفحه 3 (نظر اکثریت؛ به نقل از App. 114، 175). با این حال، شاکیان از همان ابتدا قصد داشتند شرکت‌های فاقد صلاحیت کار را انجام می‌دهند، در حالی که کسب‌وکار واجد شرایط و محرومی که قول همکاری با آن را داده بودند، صرفاً به عنوان یک واسطه عمل می‌کرد. Ante، در صفحه ۳-۴ (نظر اکثریت). به عبارت ساده، شاکیان طرحی را برای فریب PennDOT با وعده یک چیز و ارائه چیزی از نظر مادی متفاوت، طراحی کردند تا پول خود را از دست بدهند.

در این زمینه، تنها نظریه قابل قبول شاکیان در مورد اینکه چرا PennDOT متحمل هیچ خسارت مالی نشده است، به نظریه خسارت اقتصادی آنها بستگی دارد. آنها استدلال می‌کنند که اگر قربانی هیچ خسارت مالی خالصی متحمل نشود، هیچ خسارت مالی برای اهداف بند ۱۳۴۳ رخ نمی‌دهد. به خلاصه پاسخ ۲، ۸ مراجعه کنید. به گفته شاکیان، این موضوع در اینجا تفاوت ایجاد می‌کند زیرا خدمات تعمیراتی که شاکیان به PennDOT ارائه دادند، از ارزش پولی یکسانی برخوردار بودند. همان، در صفحه ۸.

بنابراین، رد نظریه خسارت اقتصادی شاکیان، این پرونده را حل می‌کند و من دلیلی برای ادامه کار نمی‌بینم. دادگاه، به هر حال، مجوز رسیدگی به تقسیم مدار در مورد خسارت اقتصادی پیشنهادی شاکیان را صادر کرد. الزام، به بخش ante، در صفحات ۴-۵ (نظر اکثریت) مراجعه کنید، و این سوالی است که حقایق این پرونده مطرح می‌کند.

بنابراین، دادگاه دلیلی برای اظهار نظر در مورد دسته‌ای از پرونده‌های ترغیب متقلبانه متمایز از این پرونده ندارد: مواردی که در آنها متهم دقیقاً کالاها یا خدماتی را که وعده داده است ارائه می‌دهد، اما به روش‌های دیگری برای ترغیب معامله دروغ می‌گوید. رجوع کنید به ante، در صفحات ۲، ۱۱ (GORSUCH, J.، موافقت جزئی و موافقت در قضاوت). طیف گسترده‌ای از رفتارهای معاملاتی روزمره ممکن است در این دسته قرار گیرند. به عنوان مثال، یک پرستار بچه را در نظر بگیرید که با دروغ گفتن در مورد نحوه استفاده از پول (برای پس‌انداز دانشگاه، به جای سفر تعطیلات بهاری) شغلی پیدا می‌کند، اما در غیر این صورت به طور کامل و رضایت‌بخش از کودک مراقبت می‌کند؛ یک فروشنده ماشین دست دوم که با ادعای دروغین مبنی بر اینکه خریدار دیگری قرار است بعداً در همان روز برای بررسی ماشین بیاید، معامله‌ای را منعقد می‌کند، در حالی که صادقانه تمام جزئیات مربوط به ماشین را فاش می‌کند؛ یا یک توسعه‌دهنده مسکن بالقوه که با دروغ گفتن در مورد تمایل، پیشنهاددهندگان رقیب را شکست می‌دهد. برای تشکیل خانواده در خانه، اما کل مبلغ پیشنهادی خود را پرداخت می‌کند. از نظر دولت، هر یک از این موارد ممکن است منجر به مسئولیت کلاهبرداری فدرال شود که مجازات آن تا 20 سال زندان است، البته تا زمانی که هیئت منصفه دروغ را "مهم" بداند. رجوع کنید به TR. of Oral Arg. 64–66; Brief for United States 44; 18 U. S. C. §1343. 
پرونده‌های آینده که چنین الگوهایی از حقایق را ارائه می‌دهند، دادگاه را ملزم می‌کنند که با محدودیت‌های بیرونی قانون کلاهبرداری فدرال روبرو شود و تصمیم بگیرد که چه چیزی عنصر مادی بودن آن را برآورده می‌کند. با این حال، حل این پرونده نیازی به چنین تعهدی ندارد. تا جایی که اکثریت در مورد امکان‌پذیری نظریه تحریک متقلبانه دولت به طور گسترده‌تر بحث می‌کنند، به عنوان مثال، رجوع کنید به ante، در صفحات 6–8، 11–12، شماره 5، من رویکرد آن را تأیید نمی‌کنم. این بحث برای حل اختلاف پیش روی ما توسط دادگاه ضروری نیست و من دلیلی برای ادامه رسیدگی گسترده‌تر از حد لازم نمی‌بینم.

II
این پرونده فقط یک سوال جزئی را مطرح می‌کند، تا حدی به این دلیل که شاکیان به مادی بودن اظهارات نادرست خود اعتراض نکرده‌اند. رجوع کنید به ante، در صفحه 16 (نظر اکثریت). این امتیاز منطقی است. می‌توان هیچ بحث واقعی وجود ندارد که اظهارات نادرست شاکیان مهم بوده است. در مقابل، قبل، در صفحات 4-11 (توماس، جی.، موافق).

الف
به یاد بیاورید که طرفین دو تفسیر رقیب از استاندارد اهمیت برای قانون کلاهبرداری سیمی فدرال ارائه کردند. به قبل، در صفحه 16 (نظر اکثریت) مراجعه کنید. شاکیان دادگاه را به آزمون "سنتی" حقوق عرفی برای اهمیت، خلاصه پاسخ 18، ارجاع می‌دهند که طبق آن، یک اظهارنامه در صورتی مهم است که ""یک انسان عاقل در تعیین انتخاب اقدام خود در معامله مورد نظر به وجود یا عدم وجود آن اهمیت دهد"" یا ""ارائه دهنده اظهارنامه بداند یا دلیلی داشته باشد که بداند که گیرنده آن موضوع را در تعیین انتخاب اقدام خود مهم می‌داند یا احتمالاً خواهد دانست"" ندر علیه ایالات متحده، 527 U. S. 1, 22, n. 5 (1999) (به نقل از بازگویی (دوم) تخلفات §538 (1977)). شاکیان ادعا می‌کنند که طبق فرمول‌بندی آنها، اظهارات لازم نیست «به اصل معامله» بپردازند تا واجد شرایط اهمیت باشند. پاسخ خلاصه ۱۸ (به نقل از بازگویی (دوم))از جرائم مدنی §551(2)(e)، نظر j). برخلاف انتظار، این دولت است که استاندارد سختگیرانه‌تری را پیشنهاد می‌دهد. این استاندارد ادعا می‌کند که اظهارات نادرست تنها در صورتی مهم هستند که به «ماهیت معامله» مورد بحث مربوط باشند. خلاصه برای ایالات متحده 44. این استاندارد از Universal Health Services, Inc. v. United States ex rel. Escobar, 579 U. S. 176 (2016) ناشی می‌شود که در مورد اهمیت تحت قانون ادعاهای نادرست بحث کرده است. به همان، در 193، شماره 5 مراجعه کنید.

دادگاه برای دانستن اینکه شاکیان به درستی اهمیت را پذیرفته‌اند، نیازی به حل این اختلاف ندارد: حتی تحت آزمون سختگیرانه‌تر «ماهیت معامله»، اظهارات نادرست شاکیان واجد شرایط است. PennDOT با شروع از خود قرارداد، صراحتاً رعایت مقررات فدرال DBE را یک اصطلاح «مهم» قرار داد. به App. 114، 175 مراجعه کنید. این یک عبارت کلیشه‌ای نبود. از میان ۱۷ ضمانت‌نامه مندرج در اسناد امضا شده، تنها الزام DBE به صراحت تصریح کرده بود که «[عدم] اجرای این الزامات توسط پیمانکار، نقض اساسی این قرارداد است که ممکن است منجر به فسخ این قرارداد شود.» همان. علاوه بر این، PennDOT یک مرحله کامل از فرآیند مناقصه قرارداد را به تأیید این موضوع اختصاص داد که پیمانکار احتمالی آن، یک شریک واجد شرایط DBE را که خدمات نقاشی ارائه می‌دهد، شناسایی کرده است. به پیوست ۳ در شماره ۱۹-۳۶۷۹ و غیره (CA3)، صفحات ۷۶۳-۷۶۵؛ ۸۲ F. 4th 230, 234 (CA3 2023) مراجعه کنید. درخواست‌کنندگان همچنین باید در طول مدت پروژه‌ها اسنادی را ارائه می‌دادند تا نشان دهند که همچنان از الزام DBE پیروی می‌کنند. به همان، در ۲۳۴ مراجعه کنید.
علاوه بر این، PennDOT نمی‌توانست پروژه‌ها را طبق بودجه تعیین شده پیش ببرد، اگر رعایت الزام DBE را به پیمانکار اجباری نمی‌کرد. کمک‌های مالی فدرال بخش قابل توجهی از بودجه PennDOT برای هر پروژه را تشکیل می‌داد و این کمک‌های مالی مشروط به رعایت DBE بود. بنابراین، الزام DBE قراردادها مستقیماً به قابلیت اجرای خود پروژه‌ها و به تبع آن، به «ماهیت معامله» مربوط می‌شد. خدمات بهداشت جهانی، 579 ایالات متحده، در صفحات 193-194، شماره 5 (به نقل از Junius Constr. Corp. v. Cohen، 257 N. Y. 393, 400, 178 N. E. 672, 674 (1931))؛ رجوع کنید به. 579 U. S.، در صفحه 194 (با تشخیص اهمیت موضوع که در آن «اگر مأموران دولت می‌دانستند که پیشنهادها تبانی هستند، پول دولت هرگز در صندوق مشترک برای پرداخت به پاسخ‌دهندگان قرار نمی‌گرفت» (به نقل از پرونده سابق ایالات متحده، Marcus v. Hess، 317 U. S. 537، 543 (1943)).


اگر این کافی نبود، PennDOT در صورت عدم اجرای برنامه DBE با حسن نیت، با خطر تحریم قانونی مواجه می‌شد. به 49 CFR §§26.101، 26.107؛ 2 App. در شماره 19-3679 و غیره، در صفحه 305 مراجعه کنید («اگر [دریافت‌کننده کمک هزینه] از رعایت هرگونه الزام ذکر شده در این قانون،» از جمله الزام DBE، «آنها می‌توانند مشمول اقدامات اجرایی رسمی یا تحریم‌های برنامه‌ای مانند تعلیق یا فسخ بودجه فدرال یا امتناع از تأیید پروژه‌ها، کمک‌های مالی یا قراردادها تا زمان رفع آن نواقص»). اصلاح‌شده")؛ همان، در صفحه ۲۹۰ ("[اگر] شما برنامه خود را با حسن نیت اجرا نکنید،... [شما] مشمول توقیف احتمالی بودجه، لغو بودجه یا سایر تحریم‌های موجود توسط وزارتخانه خواهید شد"). غیرممکن است که رعایت الزامات DBE برای PennDOT بی‌اهمیت بوده باشد، زمانی که آگاهی از طرح شاکیان برای نادیده گرفتن این الزامات، PennDOT را در معرض خطر عواقب قانونی جدی قرار می‌داد. به خدمات بهداشت جهانی، ۵۷۹ ایالات متحده، در صفحه ۱۹۴ مراجعه کنید ("[یک] واقعیت فاش نشده [مهم] است" که در آن "[هیچ کس] نمی‌تواند با دلیل بگوید که شاکی اگر از احتمال" واقعیت فاش نشده مطلع می‌شد، این قرارداد را امضا می‌کرد" (به نقل از Junius Constr. Corp.، ۲۵۷ N. Y.، در صفحه ۴۰۰، ۱۷۸ N. E.، در صفحه ۶۷۴)).
به طور خلاصه، رعایت DBE هیچ شرط "جزئی یا بی‌اهمیتی" نبود. در فهرستی از سایر الزامات پرداخت، پنهان شده بود. خدمات بهداشت جهانی، 579 ایالات متحده، در صفحه 194. این نقش مهمی در توانایی PennDOT برای دستیابی به هدف اساسی قراردادها داشت: تکمیل پروژه‌های بازسازی. این نقش به طور برجسته در قراردادها و در خود فرآیند مناقصه نمایان بود. و شاکیان به خوبی از اهمیت آن برای PennDOT آگاه بودند. به هر حال، آنها یک طرح کامل را برای پنهان کردن عدم انطباق خود ترتیب دادند. بنابراین، حتی تحت استاندارد سختگیرانه‌تر دولت، به سختی می‌توان اهمیت اظهارات نادرست شاکیان را انکار کرد.


این هیچ پاسخی برای این ادعا نیست که کلاهبرداری DBE "شایع" است. Ante، در صفحه 9 (توماس، جی.، موافق). "بسیاری از مردم این کار را انجام می‌دهند" هرگز و نباید دفاعی در برابر مسئولیت کیفری بدون موارد بیشتر باشد. علاوه بر این، هیچ بخش ذکر شده‌ای از پرونده، این دیدگاه را تأیید نمی‌کند که PennDOT "به طور منظم قراردادها را به طور کامل پرداخت می‌کرد، علیرغم آگاهی واقعی از نقض الزامات [مربوط]. خدمات بهداشت جهانی، 579 U.S.، در صفحه 195، یا اینکه PennDOT «فرض می‌کند که تعداد قابل توجهی از پیمانکارانش مفاد قرارداد را که مستلزم رعایت DBE است، نقض می‌کنند»، در صفحه 8 (THOMAS, J.، موافق). اگر این درست بود، شاکیان هیچ دلیلی برای ایجاد یک طرح پیچیده برای پنهان کردن عدم رعایت خود در اولین طرح نداشتند.آس. 
گزارش‌های عمومی از دهه‌ها قبل در مورد «مشکلات جدی اجرا و انطباق» با یک برنامه فدرال، اهمیت شرایط صریح قراردادی که مستلزم انطباق هستند را نیز نفی نمی‌کند. Ante، در 9 (THOMAS, J.، موافق) (به نقل از جلسه استماع نظارت در مورد حذف اتلاف، کلاهبرداری و سوءاستفاده در برنامه‌های حمل و نقل اجباری در کمیته حمل و نقل و زیرساخت مجلس، 108th Cong.، جلسه اول، 109 (2003)).1 ما هرگز پیشنهاد نکرده‌ایم، چه رسد به اینکه چنین گزارش‌هایی را به متهمان کارت رهایی از زندان بدهیم. به دلایل موجه: این دیدگاه بر این فرض استوار است که هر زمان که کلاهبرداری شایع باشد، هیچ پیمانکار معقولی نمی‌تواند انتظار انطباق را داشته باشد، حتی در جایی که قرارداد صراحتاً انطباق را اساسی می‌داند. پذیرش این فرض، وارونه کردن قانون قرارداد است. طرفین به صراحت شرایط قراردادی را به عنوان اساسی تعیین می‌کنند تا از انطباق اطمینان حاصل شود، به ویژه در مواردی که طرف دیگر ممکن است در غیر این صورت انطباق نداشته باشد.
شاکیان با این استدلال که در برهه‌ای از آینده، طرح قانونی DBE ممکن است خلاف قانون اساسی تلقی شود، در اعتراض به ماهیت آن نیز با مشکل مشابهی مواجه می‌شدند. در واقع، شاکیان در هیچ زمان مناسبی، چالشی را در مورد قانون اساسی بودن برنامه DBE مطرح نکردند و طرح قانونی DBE همچنان قانون خوبی است (همانطور که در زمان محکومیت شاکیان بود).2 ناگفته پیداست که قانون نباید بر اساس پیش‌بینی‌های شخصی و ناگفته از قانون اساسی بودن یک قانون، سپری در برابر مسئولیت کیفری فراهم کند.

در اصل، این پرونده یک طرح کلاسیک برای کلاهبرداری ارائه می‌دهد: شاکیان، PennDOT را فریب دادند تا برای یک چیز پول بپردازد و سپس چیزی اساساً متفاوت تحویل دادند. دادگاه امروز به درستی معتقد است که متهم در آن موقعیت نمی‌تواند با ادعای اینکه قربانی با این وجود هیچ ضرر اقتصادی خالصی متحمل نشده است، از مسئولیت کلاهبرداری فدرال فرار کند. بر این اساس، من با تصمیم نهایی اکثریت برای تأیید حکم دادگاه حوزه سوم موافقم. ________________________________________

1 قاضی توماس ظاهراً موافق است. به بخش 9-10، شماره 2 مراجعه کنید. اگرچه نظر موافق او «دلایلی را برای این فکر مطرح می‌کند که مفاد DBE «به اصل معامله» اشاره نکرده است» تا «تردید او را در مورد اینکه اظهارات نادرست شاکیان مهم بوده است» توضیح دهد، بخش 1، 6، قاضی توماس بعداً اذعان می‌کند که بحث او در مورد این گزارش‌ها فقط برای این است که نشان دهد «تحلیل اهمیت او ممکن است در پیگردهای مختلف انطباق با DBE که در آن «اهمیت مورد بحث است» اعمال شود» و سابقه متفاوتی تهیه شده است، بخش 9-10، شماره 2. من با نظر او در مورد تحلیل اهمیت مناسب موافق نیستم، اما حداقل همه موافقند که چنین گزارش‌هایی در این مورد بی‌ربط هستند.
2 به بخش 11، شماره 2 مراجعه کنید. 3 (توماس، جی.، موافق) (نشان دهنده توافق بر این است که در نتیجه، شاکیان نمی‌توانستند در این زمینه استدلالی مبنی بر اهمیت موضوع مطرح کنند).
